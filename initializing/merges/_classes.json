Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.\n\nDruid spells are oriented toward nature and animals—the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.\n\nAdditionally, choose two proficiencies from the following:\n+ Animal Handling\n+ Arcana\n+ Insight\n+ Medicine\n+ Nature\n+ Perception\n+ Religion\n+ Survival",
