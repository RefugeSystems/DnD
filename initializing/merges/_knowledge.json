For instance, a 2<sup>nd</sup> enchantment would likely cost ${4000,,orange}$G extra, and a 3<sup>rd</sup> an extra ${9000,,orange}$G, and so on.\n\n+ After 2 Enchantments:\nA D20 is rolled and on [Number of Enchantments] * 2 or lower, the item becomes inert and can no longer be enchanted.\n\nie. A short sword has an accuracy and a 1d4 cold enchantment and you go to add +1 damage. The enchantment will cost ~${2000,,orange}$ additional gold to maintain the other enchantments and if a 4 or less is rolled, the item is disenchanted and inert. The blacksmith will also likely keep your money.\n\nWhile you know all of this, it generally seems more a rule of thumb and there may be ways around it and in other cases, stronger enchantments that blacksmiths have less experience with may behave quite differently.\n\nTypically, low level enchantments such as 1d6 of magical damage or resistance or basic additional accurracy average ${200,,orange}$G, while more advanced versions, such as a 1d12 versions average around ${1000,,orange}$G base.\n\n",

			"description": "Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover. \nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover. \nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend. \nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. \nA target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.",

Though, notably, ${Natty,,darkorange}$ makes a name for herself jumping on the bartender.\n\nWith information but the door, ${Norwind,,darkorange}$ and ${Xylaris,,darkorange}$ set out to investigate the door and stumbled across a large intimidating presence leaving the door.\n\n${Norwind,,darkorange}$ followed the figure to the cliffs where it simply walked off the cliff and into the water around 100 feet below, and after careful observation, the figure never appeared to surface.\n\n${Xylaris,,darkorange}$ snuck into the factory in search of some information and found dozens dead and stuffed into a room. On looking further she got distracted and trapped in a room as workers in the factory searched for what happened. On sneaking out, she caught the attention of one of the workers and ran off, losing him with an illusionary spell as a temporary distraction before meeting up with ${Norwind,,darkorange}$ and going back to see what the group was up to in the room ${Norwind,,darkorange}$ got.\n\nThey found the rest of the group asleep in the room, and woke them all to tell them about the giant figure. After a sleepy bit of arguing, items are found to be missing and it seems they've been robbed in the night, and after assessing the situation head back to the boat to sleep.\n\nOn waking up, the town has a small group of soldiers patrolling the city and on speaking to the learn that around 150 people had been killed in the small part of the factory where they found the bodies and that the only ${Orange Crystals}$ and that he loves Turkey Legs, a bit rare in the area.\n\n${Natty,,darkorange}$ and ${Orla,,darkorange}$ explored the factory with their soldier escort and learned of off the book shipments from the factory to the Arcane Society and explored the Barracks under the factory and found a few closed off stairwells that went further below but had been sealed due to instability in the caves below.\n\n${Xylaris,,darkorange}$ found the pickpockets and followed them for a few hours, finding them making deals in back alleys and selling some of their stuff that had been stolen the night before. And after following them a bit more, caught them arguing over a small impromptu stash on the edge of the city where she found a ${Red Crystal}$.\n\n${Norwind,,darkorange}$ & ${Torrin,,darkorange}$ managed to procure shipping rights to the coastal town of ${Ascaqua,,darkorange}$ that had recently been all but destroyed in what has been learned to be a malicious force seeking ${Soul Stones}$ which the city needed to help with rebuilding.\n\nWhen asking for the crystals, a ${Jim,,darkorange}$ introduced himself and not-so-subtly slipped \"Umoya\" into his greeting, a word used when dropping off crates for the ${Thieve's Guild}$, backing off when he realized that he was incorrect.   \n\nLast seen, ${Torrin,,darkorange}$ was delivering the retrieved crystals to the boat with their permission to leave the secured harbor as ${Natty,,darkorange}$ and ${Norwind,,darkorange}$ lead ${Jim,,darkorange}$ to the bar to retrieve their forged note that he was tasked with taking to ${General Sanquist}$ in the morning to figure out where the additional crystals were to come from.",

Meanwhile, a shadowy figure caught the eye of ${Norwind}$, who then found that the ${Demon from Sa Brac}$ ventured back to meet up with his compatriots to bring them up to speed on his findings.\n\nOn his way back, he stumbled across ${Amavie}$ and ${Cellea}$, recognizing them as librarians and intrigued by the feline features, he followed them down to ${Ixa's Pub}$, where he ran into the rest of the group as well.\n\nDrinking and talking ensued where the group learned of a half-elf in the city with a large black crossbow that seemed to be cursed with a heavy shadow and ${Xylaris}$'s eye was caught by a shadowy figure seeming to stalk around the bar, but if someone was there, they eluded her. Returning, the group seemed in good spirits as ${Torrin}$ and ${Norwind}$ flirted with ${Amavie}$ and ${Cellea}$, earning an invite to the Gala at the request of ${Amavie}$ herself, and ${Torrin}$ a particularly rough, but great night with ${Cellea}$ despite ${Orla}$'s attempts to the contrary.\n\nDuring the rest of the flirting and chatting, the group also met the other librarians;\n+ ${Urunte}$ A particularly stoic white dragonborn, who works with the jovian half-elf ${Bisum}$ to maintain the ${Historical}$ section on the top floor of the library\n+ ${Celec}$ New to the library and now overseeing the ${Arcane Spells}$ section.\n+ ${Horus}$ A casual human male who oversees the ${Alchemy}$ keenly noted as having a connection to the Theives' Guild.\n+ ${Storvia}$ An eccentric female Gnome overseeing the ${Enchanting}$ section.\n+ ${Tekusa}$ A somewhat weak, but sharp female elf who knows a great deal about the geology of the world and is responsible for the ${Geological Information}$ within the library.\n+ and ${Ithim}$, insolent and not quite liked by everyone but is well managed by ${Amavie}$ and does a maticulous job of maintaining the ${Retired Books}$ in the basement of the library.\n\nA number of other assistants come and go, but notably ${Niena}$, a blue female Dragonborn and a black male Dragonborn ${Drovac}$ manage the reception desk.\n\nAs the Gala started, many poeple arrived, including a delegation of ${Nautilin Librarians}$ ran into him on the third floor and fumbled a few attempts at convincing him that she was following after him with a crush that he didn't seem to buy. After which she followed him to the basement and the minimalist decorations giving little to no cover had him run into her again before joining the Gala himself.\n\nShortly after while patrolling the floors, ${Torrin}$ found 2 dead guards on the third floor and set out to notify the guards, who then followed ${Lar}$'s pre-described protocol to lock down the building. Securing everyone in the 2-story ballroom, Draconian Guards secured the first floor and the librarians while ${Orla}$ and ${Torrin}$ set out to sweep the building from the basement up. ${Norwind}$, ${Natty}$, and ${Xylaris}$ staying in the ballroom to help guard against the suspected attack.\n\nWhile sweeping the second floor, a huge crossbow bolt ripped through the walls of the library. shreading several guards and greatly wounding ${Urunte}$ and ${Bisum}$, as well as almost knocking ${Orla}$ unconscious.

			"description": "Finishing some last minute shopping before heading to Claruthano, the group prepared for the long trip ahead, gathering normal supplies and a Fairy-esq cap that seems to have left ${Anna}$ as they sailed across the seas.\n\nThe trip was rather uneventful but the arrival proved intriguing, as they found 3 distinct groups of recent foot prints pointing to more people being on the island.\n\nAs they set off into the jungles, they found a small wolf's den and ${Orla}$ managed to befriend a lone wolf who had came up from the den to investigate what was happening. While talking to their new friend, the group learned that the pack was away, and that the Dragon of their interest seems to hunt during the morning light. They thanked the wolf, leaving food for him and his pack, and set off on their way.\n\nSetting up camp, the first night seemed uneventful, but the morning was intriguing, with the Dragon hunting and the group managing to catch a hint of 4 other Dragons on the continent as the light shone through the clouds. The Dragon of their interest near-by. Their scent seemed to almost get caught as they lingered near-by, trying to track the beast, and watched it fly back towards some mountains before losing it in the distance, gathering that it seemed to reside slightly north of where ${Lemuli}$ indicated his camp was.\n\nDuring their travels, a thick magical storm seemed to cover the jungle land where they were. After a few hours of investigating and pondering as they traveled, they concluded it must have something to do with the Dragons on the continent. What that relationship was however eluded them.\n\nTraveling farther, the group sought the camp first, hoping to find left overs or clues. In the midst of their sleep during their third night, the group was beset by an unknown group of people with an unknown intent, managing to defend themselves, ${Torrin}$ had a small barbecue with one of them, the rest seeming to disappear afterwards with the cover of night, and with their camp in disarray, the group decided to disembark as well as they were nearing the camp.\n\nDescending a steep cliff, they used a grappling hook and left it for a hopeful quick return and crossed a vast barren field that they soon discovered was covered with holes connecting to a large spider burrow below, with uniquely large 3 foot tall spiders with long legs and thick bodies. Not quite giant and not quite cuddly. Sneaking across the field at night proved somewhat useful as the spiders seemed only passingly interested in the distrubances they were making, but as the spiders slowly caught up to the group, they found a need to quickly run for the end of the field, embarking in a mix of running and jumping to quick escape as the spider nest descended upon them after several attempts at distracting the hungry beasts.\n\nWhile they managed to make it through the spiders, it came at a heavy cost as almost everyone was poisoned and not in terribly good shape. Looking around, they pooled their antidotes and ${Torrin}$s for the group.\n\nOnce everyone was healed, they finished their trek to the camp. On arriving, they found the barren remains of a camp that appeared to have been picked over and all but washed away. As they stopped to rest, ${Xylaris}$ kept watch and managed to catch sight of 2 travelers heading toward their new resting place.\n\nSetting up for an ambush, the pair found themselves caught off gaurd but managed to easily put down the would be attackers, ${Xylaris}$ commanded the other to answer several questions.\n\nThrough the interrogation, they learned that the people attacking them were seemingly not part of the first group to attack them and that these 2 were actually servants of ${Cthulhu}$ is likely the one responsible for the destruction of his village.\n\nHowever, while talking, they caught notice of the first killed servant seeming to return to life, though the turning of his flesh seemed to indicate more of a zombie like return than a resurrection. Not wanting to find out, the group quickly dispatched and burned [${Ret-Con}$] the bodies to ensure they stayed dead.\n\nNow, they prepare themselves, determining whether to set off south to visit the ${Temple of Cthulhu}$'s enchanting stones.",

			"description": "Venturing out towards the temple across the plains, several scouts were observed a top the cliffs edge during the night as the group set out and made camp at night, managing to hide their pressence on the open plains. Climbing the cliff wall, they continued toward the temple and found several interesting points.\n\nAside from the temple itself, four Sheep pens to its West with only one pen holding any sheep pens, and a small corn field to its East with what appeared to be crystalline like corn husks. Ten guards patrolled or watched these various points of interest as the group planned how to attempt to deal with them.\n\nSettling on attempting to distract the guards at the Sheep pen and lure them into a trap, success was found with a minicry sheep cry from ${Torrin}$ obscured one of the sheep. A guard was successfully lured out but managed to notice a lack of tracks into the forest. And while one guard was caught and killed, the other managed to alert the others.\n\nIn the fray, the guards dispersed, coming to help and one going into the Temple to get further assistance. One of the guards by the corn grabbed the ${Golden Husk}$ and vanished from the group's sight.\n\nWatching the ${Golden Husk}$ disappear into the forest, most of the group set off after it, everyone running at full pace and spreading out as the head Priest of the Temple, a Cleric or Paladin or some sort, came from the Temple accompanied by a two headed Orc.\n\nKeeping their pace, the group continued toward the corn field as they lost sight of their two new foes, greeting them near the corn field as they broken their ${Invisibility}$ but with more control.\n\nAs the group fought, ${Norwind}$ managed to kill and lay the final servant to rest and began to make his way over to the rest of the group.\n\n${Norwind}$ help, leading the 2 leaders to retreat to within the Temple.\n\nWith the guards slain and the leaders in their temple, the group set out to attempt to to retrieve one of the corn husks, cutting a ${Red Husk}$ from its stalk from afar. They watched as it floated instead of falling, ducking to avoid what seemed to be a pending explosion, the entire field erupted as the other crystals exploded in the blast. The entire field now dust and ash, even deep into the ground, the roots seemingly lost as well.\n\nPushing forward they sought to get through the door and were met with a magical barrier that they managed to dispell and sneak into the temple. The first set of guards they came across seemed content with no one managing to enter the temple and did not notice thew group as they setup to kill the guards swiftly, one guard seeming to get some kind of call out but no one else seemed to come to his aid as the group finished him.\n\nContinuing into the Temple, the group found a large room with several servants talking inside the room. An attempt to kill them and funnel them into the room seemed to fall short as small arcane toxic flowers started to grow in their rooms and release some kind of gas. Running through, the group found that the gas was quite toxic (${4d10,,orange}$ Necrotic) and with an exploratory plan, threw a servant into the gas, and found that the servants seem unaffected by it.\n\nDispelling a flower and closing the door to the other room, they secured themselves from the other side and regrouped. Deep inside the Temple, they planned their next move...",

After some traveling they managed to find a small stop to pull into along the shore with a stone staircase up to the top of the sheer cliff. And along the top they found a destroyed mining town and an abandoned carriage.\n\nVenturing to the carriage, they discovered it was badly damaged and seemed like it happened about a month ago. Looking around they found some crystals but also a blue crystal spider seemingly packed in with the crystals. Meanwhile ${Orla}$. Looking it over, they found it too damaged for an easy repair but salvaged some of the wood to help repair the boats.\n\nGoing to the mining town, they did some exploring but the town seemed old and desolate.

But some investigating found a couple axes, some more pickaxes, and a small hand cart they could use to carry items around.\n\nHeading back to the boats, they packed everything in and got ready to continue down the shore to the South Eastern forests...",

Investigating the area, the grass appeared normal other than the odd circular-ness and openness of the field. The cave appeared a normal cave aside from a symbol, <span class=\"rs-darkorange ra ra-gemini\"></span>, of which ${Torinn}$'s senses, the group descended into the cave.\n\nWhile dark, a light seemed to flicker once they were deeper in the cave. Calling out to what they expected to be a friendly pressence quickly turned out to be ${Kintari}$ seemingly patrolling the area. Quickly dispatching the pests, the group suffered minimal injuries before continuing further into the cave.\n\nReaching the end, they found a bowl with a blue glowing bubble around it, seemingly at the end of the cave. Familiar with blue glowing fields, they toyed with placing a blue power crystal into it and eventually left the crystal inside the field, watching a secret door as the crystal dissolved inside the field.\n\nRushing through the door before it closed, they all made it inside, the door closing right behind them. The area before them seemingly a place of worship, ancient pews lay before them along with tattered bookshelves and destroyed books. Looking around they found a few things in near by rooms, but nothing of seeming significance before wandering into what appeared to be the main room, opting for the source of the call before exploring a near by locked room.\n\nThe main hall was overgrown with grass and ruined rocks, a few noting that grass seemed odd down here with no light to feed it until they noticed a large circular ceiling that they suspected aligned with the odd clearing above and an odd connection with the vegetative life in the room. It wasn't long after entering the hall however that they heard a voice call to them faintly, asking them to accept a gift if they can survive. A small glowing ball slowly manifesting in the middle of the hall under the center of the odd circle. Hesitant, but determined, they all placed a hand on the glowing orb to accept the would be gift, the odd circle above clearing as the storm ravaged above, culminating in a large bolt of lightning striking them all.\n\nWhile many fell unconscious, those that managed to continue standing nursed their battered ears as they revived and supported one another, slowly resting to regain their sense of balance. Looking around, the storm above had cleared to mere clouds, the orb was gone, and the ceiling gave no signs of resealing.\n\nThe main change seemed to be a collective pounding headache and new found knowledge about the world swirling in their heads. The name ${Whaitiri}$ seemingly important. And after some time recovering, they all collective found a message somehow embedded in their new knowledge.\n\n<div class=\"rs-blue\">\n<p>Friends, our time is short as my connection with all of you seems to be weak. The knowledge now in your heads is a blessed collection from my followers who once worshiped me here. I hope I am not wrong in entrusting this information with you, but I certainly can not let it fall to the Kintari who are here in search of how to obtain it themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully this anthology serves you well and may your Travels flow true.</p>\n</div>\n\nTaking their time, they all searched their minds, exploring the depths of their new found experiences and found themselves closer to understanding much more regarding the existence and nature of the world.\n\nTheir self discovery however was cut short. A sharp sense of invasion in their minds as their connection with the temple sharpened. Everyone keenly aware of Kintari entering the temple and heading towards them.\n\nExamining their situation, they were aware the fight would be hard, the first wave of Kintari reaching the door as they decided to attempt to flee through the open roof. As ${Natty}$ and managed to destroy one other doors, allowing a few to rush into the room.\n\nThe ensuing fight proved nearly fatal. The warriors attacking proving hearty and deadly as ${Orla}$ suffered several substantial wounds as they made their last moves to escape.\n\nOut from the cave, ${Orla}$ using a momentary reprieve to retrieve his grappling hook before the group took off back towards their rowboats.\n\nHaving had a long night rowing their boats, another long night running through the forest had started to prove exhausting, but the group managed to climb into the trees and get a long rest in the safety of their branches under the disapproving glare of a near by ${Sloth}$.\n\nIgnoring the slow, judgmental creature, the group left in the morning back towards their boats, finding them intact and seemingly no ${Kintari}$ before they are found....",

She even chuckled at his question regarding the homeless in the area.\n\nMeeting ${Via}$.\n\nHeading out to search for the temples, the group ran across a small group of ${Panthers}$, deadly mutations of the usual panther.\n\nFollowing the trail that ${Eldith}$ was experiencing and he found himself much calmer.\n\nKnowing that the cave seemed to be to ${Athena}$ near the where the relic should have been and saved them for possible searching later.\n\nLeaving the cave, they discussed checking the other caves for possible other relics or calling it a night for now and returning to ${Via}$.\n\nIn the mountains, the group ran into a Leoterran patrol and in talking with the soldiers, the group managed to convince them that they were on an expedition for the ${Arcane Society}$. The trek took a few days back and forth, but they were registered and officially on a \"sanctioned\" expedition, complete with a regiment to protect them while they explore the caves, the same regiment who brought them in to register.\n\nWhen they get to the area where the cave should be, ${Baydel Sajie}$ and that was why there were some 80 caves in the area, but most were only 10 to 20 meters deep and easily checked. Investigating the area, the group found 5 candidates, 1 semi-questionable cave and 4 that seemed to have real depth to explore.\n\nDelving into the questionable cave first, they quickly found a dead end and dilligently searching around after dealing with a number of illusary blockages, they stumbled upon a switch, which ${Ginnet}$ spell greatly reducing the pain of the landing.\n\nComposing themselves, getting out seemed troublesome, but ambient noise, like groaning or rumbling lead them to explore the 3 cave like exits from the room, leaning towards the one that seemed somewhat constructed. Alternating casts of ${Detect Magic}$ magic seemingly wandering about in the walls of the cave as they explored.\n\nFinding a deadend, they noted a skeleton and 2 chests. Weary of the magic they detected and of the noises in the cave, they hid in the deadend, waiting to see what came to pass, but found the skeleton slowly reanimating, bandages appearing from the aether as it quickly shifted into a ${Mummy}$ magic coming from them.\n\nDeeper in the cave in another direction, they found a giant door that ${Ginnet}$.\n\nEngaging the awoken ${Mimic}$, the group maanged to kill it but found that other chests had moved in behind them. Securing their spot in the cave, they pondered how to slip out from the cave...",

			"description": "Taking a few days to recuperate from their arduous adventure on ${Sulendirida}$ inside.\n\nRested, they reviewed their predicament and attempted to triangulate the location of the ${Blade of the Mist}$.\n\nOn their way to the diplomatic city, they saw a strange phenomenon, and exceeding bright explosion that seemed to be quite far away. Their best guess was that it was somewhere out in the ${Sumaku}$ a bit more on guard.\n\nTheir stop in ${Racual}$ would be able to impartially confirm what had been found.\n\nAfter some discussion over ${Qua Silverborn}$.\n\nThe trip to the lab was peaceful, but shortly before reaching ${Vatnunda}$s.\n\nRowing out to the seemingly pleasant small beach island, ${Norwind}$ suspected were 2 caves, each with a large carnivorous plant inside.\n\nWith some divine assistance they decided on the left, and with ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$'s help, her flying through the cave and avoiding the plant, they found there was a yellow barrier at the end of the cave. Pondering for a moment on how to deal with the plant, they decided to careful prune the plant and slowly work their way to the back of the cave. And while they accomplished the task with ease, it toko quite some time, their athletic bonuses fading, though having helped with the task.\n\nConfronted with the barrier, it seemed to encompass a great drop, ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ found the ground a few moments ahead of her.\n\nOn landing, she found a small laboratory and 3 rooms that seemed to have odd pedestals in their centers. Exploring further, she managed to find and somewhat repair a small lift in the the center where she landed and used it to retrieve everyone else and bring them down.\n\nWhile in the lab, they poked around and managed to retrieve a ${Arcanic Channeling Staff}$ to one of the displays and additionally noticed that the panel seemed to rest after they all left the room. The final action to finding the staff seeming to be pressing a crystal to a display in the laboratory room and letting it consume the power crystal in question, which has thus far been red power crystals.\n\nWorking through the other rooms, they found the lab's interfaces in the remaining rooms somewhat confusing. The right room seemed to prompt for some kind of arcane energy trigger whenever a power crystal was placed against its sole floating glass pane, a faint feeling of needing to apply the energy to continue with some process. The left room had several floating glass panels that required the far middle pane to have a crystal pressed to it before any other panes would respond. But after trying all the colors to the main pane and then trying Red, Green, and Blue in various combinations on the three inner panels and the adjacent 120<sup>o</sup> panes, they seemed no closer to understanding than before, except now an alarm seemed to be sounding. With several red crystals consumed and only having 2 left, the group decided to call it a day and found themselves confronted by some kind of security system when they tried to leave.\n\n${Torinn}$ managed to restore power to the lift by channeling a Red and Green power crystal into the system, consuming both in the process. With only 1 Red crystal left, the group packed up and left, lowering the lift back into place and hoping that whatever was inside was safely protected for them to come retrieve later when they had more power crystals with which to use below.\n\nContinuing their journey, they made for the southern tip of ${Lurus}$ and setup rope for everyone.\n\n${Natty}$ find a few herbs.\n\nVenturing deeper inland and following a trail, the group made their way toward a canyon entrance that seemed to be in the distance and after a few hundred studs found that they didn't seem to be getting any closer. Walking for a bit more, the area seemed to become enveloped in a thick mist, the group tying themselves together with rope so as not to lose one another.\n\nSending ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$, the group prepared to explore the this new area....",

And while he appreciated their intentions and the extent of their destiny, he could not simply hand over the piec, that the ritual demanded that combat ensue for them to earn the piece they sought.\n\nThe fight that ensued was difficult for the group. Managing to do a fairly large sum of damage to him before his turn came about and power glowing orbs flew off from him, disappearing into the mist. Their varied colors the 3 Primary Colors (Red, Green, and Blue) and 3 Secondary Colors (Cyan, Yellow, and Purple) of the Power Crystal Spectrum. Further, he seemed to radiate an aura of ${Psychic}$'s magical bolts.\n\nFighting themselves on tightropes, they inquired with the forgiving guardian who noted that while they may fear their lives are in jeopardy, they were not and he allowed them to yield to the gaurdian. With the ritual ended, he began to leave, being convinced to answer 2 questions of the group's as he began to seek a new position at which to offer his challenge. From their inquiry they learned the guardian's name as ${Guarvello}$'s stones keeping them safe from the cold.\n\nLooking around the barren tundra for shelter, ${Torinn}$ that were patroling the land.\n\nBack aborad the ${Sorafin}$.\n\nSeemingly half way to ${Racual}$ noted that it was probably waiting to see if they were stuck or would eventually sink, but the ship was in good enoough shape to travel, if ever so slightly curved.\n\nSlinking their way into the port of ${Racual}$ would be able to handle it.\n\nHeading into town, the group bought 2 rooms for 2 nights, negotiating a decent discount to 150${G}$, to get them through the nights and enjoyed the complementary buffet that came with it.\n\nVisiting the castle for more information, ${Torinn}$ or of a related political nature.\n\nLeaving from there, they sought their previous political friend ${Inare Kuris}$'s entourage. As they left her, she seemed to be looking for someone of importance whose ear should could grab for more information.\n\nThey finished their time in the city, drinking and eating at the buffet and on their last day were confronted by a small well dressed gnome who meekly inquired about speaking to ${Orla}$, which he seemed to find slightly questionable but left it and thanked her for her time, hoping to see her again some day.\n\nThough, as the group watched over their small friend, they found ${Natty}$'s lap and the pair seemed as happy as clam.\n\nTwo days of repair now past, the group set off back to the dock to find their crew wrapping up. ${Engram}$ as he laughed and was happy to see that something might finally catch that rat as though it had been his nemisis while they were gone.\n\nSetting out to sea in their freshly repaired ship, the ${Sorafin}$.\n\nAlmost a week later, they found themselves off the frigid shores of ${Intis}$ out to the coast as the city has no dock. On arriving, they sought out a near by local old man who seemed to almost have a heart attack trying to run from them. Talking to him, they learned that the city is mostly populated by researchers and those seeking isolation, bringing almost no visitors, and the last group to visit brought violence with them. Inquiring however, the old man seemed reluctant to talk and mentioned that the Inn is likely where they'd like to head.\n\nReaching the ${Finyelela Inn}$ noted that the book had been there for several months and welcomed the small gnome to keep it if she'd like.\n\nHeading south, they followed the path through the mountains, keeping an eye open for anything unusual...",

More patrols were around the city and banners hung in several places announcing and celebrating the coming ${Imperial Expedition Gala}$ sometime the next day.\n\nAt the library, they couldn't find their acquaintance ${Horus}$. Inquiring a bit, they learned that many of the librarians were out or busy due to the Gala, but the library was still open for people to peruse.\n\nBooks in hand, their next stop was the ${Quartermaster}$ as punishment for something the quartermaster opted not to repeat.\n\nWalking to the castle, they were taken to visit ${Lar}$'s teams before their meeting with him. Catching him up on their activities, they learned 2 things:\n+ An ${Assassin}$ is in the city that is after two librarians, but he noted that another team was already handling that as well as additional security.\n+ ${Po}$\n+ The next day, ${Po}$\n+ The ${Scry}$ of the library\n+ The recipe for ${Spell Ink}$\n\n${Ash}$ slowly browsed as the smaller dwarf scurried about the library between all the decorating, copying spells and the alchemy recipe she managed to find.\n\nMeanwhile at the bar, ${Ginnet}$ caught up on his drinking, enjoying the seemingly limitless booze of the capital city.\n\nAfter meeting up, ${Eldith}$ schemed to work his way into an expedition for some coin.\n\nA bit of deceit and a sly casting of ${Friends}$, the usual payout for an expedition is 10 to 20 thousand gold, and the people hiring and the expedition groups are very discrete, only hire those who have been vetted by the library.\n\nFinishing their night out, the group slept aboard the boat and when they woke, ${Eldith}$, but her attempt failed as she resisted being targeted by the spell.\n\nDistraught but not defeated, the group headed to the castle to train and inquire about ${Teleportation Circles}$ as that was all the soldiers that could be spared, but would cost 50G a month to pay them.\n\nSpeaking with ${Cravous}$.\n\nAs they met up to finish their training and debrief, speaking briefly with ${Lar}$'s fighting ring is good for earning the respect of a sailor or 2 who may serve for a cut of what's found or at least volunteer to join if there's a decent enough showing in the ring.\n\nTaking their information in, they pondered their next move and the next day to try ${Scrying}$ once more...",

			"description": "As they ventured south in search of the lost Ambassador ${Qua Silverborn}$, they looked for tracks and followed ${Xylaris}$ and ${Norwind}$ as they followed several tracks in the soft snow.\n\nFollowing the trail for a few days with a Snow Storm slowly approaching, they found small groups of dead bodies that kept them on track, running into a couple of guards on the side of a mountain, they met ${Orvern}$ and ${Velinqu}$ that were trying to find ${Qua}$ themselves.\n\nGetting filled in on the past situation from the new pair of guards, they learned that the bodies they had followed were from assassins chasing down ${Qua}$'s guards and the guards themselves. Looking around, the group had also spotted a pair of dead bodies by a cave, which ${Orvern}$ and ${Velinqu}$ confirmed as where they suspected ${Qua}$ was hiding, but didn't feel they were enouogh to deal with whatever might be in the cave hunting or holding ${Qua}$. Their new friends brought up the rear as the rest of the group pushed forward, following a trail of blood along the rocky walls.\n\nReaching the end of a tunnel, they were confronted with a crazed guard seemingly next to a corpse, and after some failed negotiations, managed to jump and restrain him. Their new friends helping to identify the corpse as ${Qua}$ and found a note of some kind on his person. ${Torinn}$ discussing the note with the other guards, collectively agreed that the note should remain on with the body, on which ${Torinn}$ had cast ${Gentle Repose}$ to keep it from decaying.\n\nThe other guard that they subdued was no longer crazed but had passed out after being revived by ${Torinn}$. As a precaution, the group tied him up and they all started to head back to town, setting up for the first night's camp a few miles north, the ${Snow Storm}$ settling in overhead as the buried ${Qua}$'s dead body in the snow to help preserve it.\n\nAs they slept, the subdued guard woke in the middle of the night, screaming from finding himself unable to move. His screams seemed to wake the everyone in the group except ${Orla}$, who was quite soundly asleep. Even ${Orvern}$ ventured over to see what the screaming was about.\n\nSpeeaking with the now concious guard, he could not remember anything, but while he could not remember anything he was agreeable enough to being captured just confused and initially overwhelmed.\n\nAs they all started to leave the tent, a subtle orange glow caught their eye from where ${Qua's}$ body had been buried. As they moved to investigate, ${Xylaris}$ was stabbed in the back by ${Orvern}$ as the others realized that ${Qua's}$ body was being melted by lava, ${Norwind}$ quickly rushing toward the melting body and fishing out a ${Hand}$.\n\nMeanwhile, the others dispatched ${Orvern}$, his body quickly decaying and oozing out as he passed away, specs of black tar reminiscent of the ${Cthulhian Acolytes}$ littered his organs. As ${Torinn}$ went to cast ${Revivify}$, he found the body to have been dead far too long to be revived.\n\n${Torinn}$ stayed to watch over their captured guard, who acknowledging his perdictament and remained content with staying in the groups care as they hadn't hurt or injured him to his recollection and seemed to be treating him nicely enough considering. Taking a moment to raise a skeleton construct from ${Orvern}$'s corpse and naming it ${Zule the First}$.\n\nThe rest of the group gave chase to ${Velinqu}$, who was presumably the one responsible for melting ${Qua}$'s corpse.\n\nFollowing a faint trail, they found that their foe had managed to give them the slip, but after carefully back tracking their steps, they found him again and resumed their pursuit, easily finding him around a severl cliff sides by a ${Faint Orange Glow}$ that ${Orla}$ worked out to be a spell of some kind but could not make out what spell.\n\nEnding his spell, their target slipped into the ${Snow Storm}$. Quickly investigating, ${Norwind}$ was the first to get within range and managed to avoid several crossbow bolts before finding him in the snow. And after exchanging a few blows, ${Orla}$ managed to land several spells from ${Hivern}$'s back, destroying the assassin's body similar to his friends, the trio taking a moment to properly desecrate his corpse before the others arrived.\n\nRegrouping at camp, they packed up and resumed heading north. Along the way, they discussed the note they had seen on ${Qua}$'s body and recalled that it mentioned something regarding the city of ${Intis}$. On their return to the city, they dropped their captured guard off with the body under the guard of the crew and ${Zule}$. Heading back into town, they asked around about ${Qua}$ and searched his room with ${Areachei}$'s permission. In the room they found a scroll written in some kind of code and asking around they learned that ${Qua}$ had purchased several shovels and managed to unbury a trapped box that uses ${The Rising Dawn's Fang}$ as a key to uncode the scroll they found.\n\nReading the scroll, they learned that it contained the ingredients to a bomb that could render a ${Soul Stone}$ inert, releasing the souls within to ${Reykurax}$ and other realms of the afterlife or for rebirth.\n\nWith their new information in hand, the group headed for ${Racual}$, where they took the captured guard to be treated. Meeting \n${Dr. Oreleno}$, who restored their captee with ${Greater Restoration}$ through several arcane power circles inscribed into the room, allowing it to act as an advanced healing chamber. Healed and in better health, the group learned his name to be ${Gloin}$ and that he had some form of mentally imposed speech, with a tiny touch of crazy but seemed good enoough to keep around and was happy to join the ${Sorafin}$'s crew for ${50,,orange}$ gold a month, currently serving as a chef, keeping the crew's morale high with delicious food.\n\nSearching for more information on occurances around and wanting to get information about ${Qua}$ to someone of imoprtance, they spoke with ${Inare}$, and after a bit of arguing with ${Torinn}$, the group decided to head back to ${Dranous}$ to speak with ${Lar}$ as ${Inare}$ was unable to help with access to ${Indium}$.\n\nOn their way to ${Dranous}$, the group took some time to meditate and paid the crew for a total of ${450,,orange}$G. But also found that ${Gloin}$ was able to easily fit in, easily persuaded into any shenanigans by ${Xylaris}$, ${Natty}$, or even ${Torinn}$ as the group set about acting out small pranks.\n\nArriving at ${Dranous}$, the group set off to speak to ${Lar}$ and they sent ${Voro}$ off to get equipment for ${Gloin}$ and ${Zule}$.\n\nSpeaking with ${Lar}$, they brought him up to speed on their activity, informing him of ${Whaitiri}$ and the ${Kintari}$. They also learned that they'll need to move to a fully independent operation as their ${1000,,orange}$G payment today will be their last payment for awhile, though their authorization to \"burrow\" from the production factory in ${Sa Brac}$ still stands. A few important things they learned from ${Lar}$:\n\n+ ${Po}$ is retiring after the mission and ${Lar}$ has the spell scribes to teach ${Po}$'s special ${Hammock}$ spell, which he handed over.\n+ Resurrection is a nigh impossible feat for any of the wizards ${Lar}$ knows, including ${Indium}$. Thus he left ${Qua}$'s hand in their care to deal with getting additional information. Noting that being able to speak and read ${Ancient}$ is likely important.\n    + ${Norwind}$ recalls some memories of some Druids in ${Colligus}$ that may have some ability to assist or that ${Clerics}$ traveling with ${Wizards}$ may be a telling combo of people who could help.\n+ ${Lar}$'s informants heard tale of the ${Blade of Mist}$, their lost piece, being in ${Montis}$ as of ${319 Skaparvum  4}$</sub>.\n+ Toward their goal of getting to ${Reykurax}$, ${Lar}$ only knows of a few spells and ${Gate Dust}$ to get there. He also has heard of a wizard in ${Dranous}$ that has a way back and forth from ${Reykurax}$.\n+ The imperial wizards in ${Dranous}$ know a knowledge transfer spell that can force knowledge from one creature to another. It has been known to drive people insane, and has resulted in the wizards keeping to use amoung themselves.\n+ ${Lar}$ arranges some papers to to get the group access to ${Indium}$ under the cover of delivering books to ${The Cortex}$, granting them 48 hours of access to the city.\n+ ${Lar}$ is acquaintances with ${Penea}$, the head of the ${Arcane Society}$, at least passingly enouogh to coordinate an investigation into the society.\n+ The ${Giant Whirlpool}$ in the ${Sumaku Sea}$ seems to have been responsible for the destruction of the ${5th Fleet}$.\n+ ${Indium}$ should have some additional information on the old gods.\n\nFinishing with ${Lar}$, they headed out to shop and catch up on reading. So far, the group has secured cannons and set ${Engram}$ out to get the top deck reinforced for handling their ${4,,orange}$ newly purchased ${Cannons}$, but have ${6,,orange}$ days until the deck reinforcement is complete.\n\n${Braix}$ also noted several other important possible costs for modifications to the ${Sorafin}$ that they can expect when requesting the dock workers to do work, though ${Engram}$ may be able to work out some discounts:\n+ ${8000,,orange}$G to retrofit the lower deck to support Cannon placements\n+ ${20000,,orange}$G to reinforce the entire hull of the ${Sorafin}$, essentially making it impossible for a any squid short of ${Merpo}$ or ${Vonaris}$ to break.",

			"description": "Debriefed and looking around the city in the evening, the group headed toward the ${Imperial Library}$ to try to catch a look ${Gala}$. While wandering the alleys, ${Ginnet}$ spotted a small cat wandering along a fence, which he recognized as the cat that was with the two children they rescued and that ${Eldith}$ was hoping to find again some day. Pointing it out, they took off on a chase after the cat, ${Eldith}$ leading the way.\n\nThe middle of their hunt was interrupted by an explosion from the ${Gala}$, and a brief side tour followed as they investigated some tracks seeming to belong to the assassin before finding themselves too far behind to catch the assailant.\n\nHeading back toward the library to see what happened, they found a signifigant portion of the library destroyed and spoke with ${Lar}$ and got bought up to speed on parts of the night as well as meeting the other royal advisers ${Ceran}$, and ${Inale}$. Heading back out they resumed their search for the cat.\n\nDetermined in their pursuit, they managed to \"get an audience\" with the feline from a rooftop. ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ seeming to have quite the conversation with the creature before it lept off into the night. As it went, it left a ${Note}$ and a ${Belt}$ in the alley. Looking at them, the note seemed jovial enough with a \"Hello\" and a cat-paw signature. The belt gave a cat tail and improved agility, thus being immediately donned and attuned by ${Eldith}$.\n\nHeading to an Inn for the night, they get two rooms and spend the night. In the morning they head down for breakfast and catch the cat wandering in after them, seemingly calling them back to their room.\n\nInside, they have a face to face with the elf that goes by the name ${Stibusix}$, a long staff adorned with an intricuitly carved cat. Talking to the elven druid, he noted the oddities of a group of adventurers that would so brazenly run towards trouble and wanted to ask their assistance in the matter of an issue he had, a ${Book with a Gold and Silver binding}$ located somewhere in the ruins of ${Hwand}$. In exchange, he offered his staff, ${Ikatibha}$, which is enables him to travel the world so freely as a cat.\n\nTalking with him about the world, they learned that ${Hwand}$ is mostly home to creatures of the wild and only visited by young dragonlings practicing their hunting skills and not likely to stay for any larger threats. The larger issue being the magical beasts that take residence in the city, the beasts these young dragons hunt and kill for a challenging practice and are, at times, driven off by.\n\nThe group also learned of the ${The Inkanti-olo}$. The druids fellow elves of the forest who dwell with feline beasts in the wild, communing with them and helping protect them. And when last the druid saw his people, they were on the continent of ${Sulendirida}$, however that was many years ago.\n\nWith their moments discussed, the druid took off, a breakfast date with an old lady who always leaves delicious food out for him. ${Lucy}$ noting that she didn't liking him very much but ${Eldith}$ seemed quite enamoured.\n\nUsing the rest of the morning, the group took to the library, searching for spells and information and arranging for the  beforing takign to the seas and heading for ${Tertiusa}$ to enter ${Lucy}$ into the arena and try to gain favor with the local sailors in that area to get a crew.\n\nWhile sailing, ${Eldith}$ manged to ${Scry}$ on ${Inrena}$ and from the darkness outside the warehouse she was within, ${Ginnet}$ worked out that she was at least not currently on any of the below continents:\n+ Calokula\n+ Sulendirida\n+ Basel\n+ Druteta\n\nReaching the city, the group set their sights on the arena and the city's shops as ${Lucy}$ entered herself into a ${Rank 5}$ public cage fight at the ${The Petixnia}$.\n\nEasily winning the fight, ${Lucy}$ almost made quick work of her hearty Half-Orc opponent ${Sigolvi}$, though his stamina let him make a decent showing before eventually being knocked unconcious by the superior lady. As the crowd chanted her name, ${Lucy}$ performed admirably, favorably playing to the crowd and gaining a swell of reputation from her first match and earning her companions a decent amount of gold.\n\nTaking advantage of the cheering, ${Ginnet}$ spoke with several people in the crowd, notably meeting ${Linu}$ and separately later meeting ${Latu}$ amoung the others in the crowd, inviting them all to a party aboard the boat and encouraging people with the promise of coin after ${Latu}$ noted that many won't want to show up without the promise of more than food, as food is free in the ${Draconian}$ empire.\n\nStaying in and around the arena after ${Lucy}$'s match to watch the fights, the group managed to catch one of the arena champions in a Rank 10 fight, catching sight of ${Verelli}$, an agile fighter who made short work of the one who challenged him.\n\nOnce they wrapped up near the arena, they got ready for the party, which had decent showing arrive. ${Ginnet}$ ended up paying out all of his promised coin but got a few people extra. And on looking over the group and talking with everyone noted that they had 8 novice sailors appear, 2 mid teir, 2 skilled sailors, and a seemingly old captain with solid knowledge of how to handle a ship and her crew.\n\nMingling in the party and meeting everyone, many had come out of respect for ${Lucy}$, admiring her skill in the arena, encouraged by the coin and good food. Many shared stories with each other and with the group and after some time they met to determine who to hire; Settling on hiring 4 people to help round out their current crew while keeping their costs managable;\n+ 2 Novice Sailors; ${Cherub}$, and ${Fortuna}$\n+ 1 Mid-Teir Sailor; ${Linu}$ who was skilled with handling rigging, but little else, though cheaper for it\n+ The Veteran Sea Captain ${Acrusial}$ who is skilled and wise, and quite capable of handling the ship in any circumstance. And also willing to work for shared loot instead of pay, settling on every 9<sup>th</sup> item after some negotiation from ${Lucy}$.\n\nAs the day came to an end, the rest of the party that wasn't hired headed home or to the arena as the group spent the rest of the night talking with their crew, both new and old, as they all got to know each other...",

			"description": "Having finished talking to Lar and having a relaxing night, the group spent the morning meditating on the  knowledge deep within their minds. Taking the morning slowly and catching up on research; ${Xylaris}$ and ${Orla}$ heading to the ${Imperial Library}$ to research potions and spells, ${Norwind}$ catching up with his guild, and everyone shopping around the city as the ${Imperial Gala}$ setup and got ready. However ${Natty}$ was left home sick with a cough, but ${Oh}$ happily kept her company as she rested in her bed.\n\n${Orla}$ found several tomes with spells that she wanted, leading to a group effort to buy out all the ${Spell Inkwells}$ in the city.\n\n${Xylaris}$ tried to catch the librarians that were busily running around preparing for the Gala to get information on water breathing potions, and after a few dances thanks to ${Storvia}$, she managed to convince ${Bisum}$ to point her in the right direction, eventually finding and cramming the recipe into her head over the course of the day.\n\n${Norwind}$ found ${Sarana}$ in the ${Bottoms Up}$ brothel and found an interesting contract that she needed handled involving a guild warehouse having been robbed of a little over a dozen ${Power Crystals}$, mostly of the Red, Green, and Blue variety. However the client was very unsettled and preparing to send over their own people to deal with the issue.\n\nComing together, the group opted to help ${Norwind}$ with his endeavor, head to the area near the warehouse and exploring the sewers that ${Sarana}$ had noted the warehouse guards informing her of being an escape route.\n\nSearching through the sewers, ${Xylaris}$ and ${Orla}$ lost their lunch but managed to keep their wits. As they searched, they found a trail of indiscernable footprints that seemed to come up infront of ${Huste's Toys}$, seemingly run by an extremely old, cheerful, elf that would have pre-dated the ${Cataclysm}$. Heading into the store after a quick cleaning from ${Orla}$ to get rid of the sewer smell.\n\n${Olang}$ seemed sincere in his kindness and hospitality offered to those entering his shop, ${Torinn}$ keeping a suspicious eye on the shop keeper and coming up empty handed in his suspicions. Meanwhile, ${Norwind}$ snuck into the backroom, keeping an open eye as he surveyed the storage room, finding toys for _all_ ages but no ${Power Crystals}$. Before slipping out, he grabbed an ${Arcanous Amoria}$ to help ${Orla}$, but held onto it for now.\n\nFollowing some of the kids around and speaking breifly with ${Smoky Uigi}$ and ${Bottle Bob}$, they found ${Merezisi's Orphanage}$, currently being overseen by ${Badova}$. Speaking with her, the group meets several dozen children playing around the area and ${Torinn}$ puts on a small magical show to entertain them to the children's delight, though the adults seemed a bit bored. ${Xylaris}$ noting a group of kids seemingly scheming in a corner instead of partaking of the festivities. Seeing an oppurtunity, she convinced two halfling twins to take a mechanical spider each and attempt to scare ${Torinn}$, watching as the two split up and one created an elegant distraction as the other daftly slipped the other spider onto ${Torinn}$'s shoulder without being seen and getting a small startle out of the cleric to her and the childrens amusement.\n\nFinishing with the orphanage and saying farwell to the children, they continued their investigating around further, the group set about inspecting the sewer grates they could see, noting mostly normal looking use with each one having regualr use from the city for inspection. However, one suspected grate was notably in a sealed location that seemed to be in the middle of the ${Mezzanine Artsia}$ building, a fanciful art gallery with crystal powered security and later discovered to have its walls covered in ${Adjuration}$ Magic. Sneaking over the side of the building with his ${Cape of Invisibility}$, ${Norwind}$ managed to set the sewer grate off ever so slightly providing a possible way in later at night when the security patrols should be lighter.\n\nAs he climbed over, the rest of the group sat and had a few cups of coffee at ${Cafe Intrinsa}$ near by and ${Xylaris}$ made a bit of a scene trying to sing, notably aggrevating the Mistress ${Remela}$, the curator of ${Mezzanine Artsia}$ who cast some spell to silence ${Xylaris}$, keeping her from being able to sing or speak, much to ${Torinn}$'s amusement and the thanks fo the guards and shop keepers who had asked for quiet.\n\nOnce ${Norwind}$ returned, the group set about subtly investigating the building with ${Detect Magic}$ and learned that protection spells coated the walls. Deciding to check the front entrance to the gallery and talking to ${Amuku}$, the front door guard of the Mezzanine, the group learned that entering the Mezzanine would involving unattuning all their items as weapons, even attuned and left, are not allowed in the building. ${Amuku}$ alo noted that the mistress of the gallery would likely be willing to meet them and talk to them in ${Cafe Intrinsa}$ across the street after the gallery closes, which is usually ${@7PM}$. After some group discussion however, they decided to leave the mistress of the galllery be as they continued investigating.\n\nHeading to the warehouse itself, the group met ${Crov}$ and ${Blaja}$, two half-giant guards who seemed they could kill a person with their pinky but probably couldn't solve a one piece puzzle. Talking with them, it seemed that someone had set up some kind of diversion to get their attention and then get inside to the crates, that both guards noted they had accidentally dropped exposing the crystals inside briefly, but traffic in the alley was light and no one should have seen.\n\nLearning of the trap entrance that heads only back to ${Sarana}$'s office in the brothel and that the only other entrance was the warehouse's giant shipping and receiving doors, ${Torinn}$ set about walking the grounds with ${Detect Magic}$ active, catching wind of 2 ${Scry}$ spheres, one seemingly nicely centered at the top of the warehouse entrance and another sloppily off to the side, near where the guards pointed out a crate had gone missing and where the crate that had actually gone missing was.\n\nThe story they notably told was that ${Crov}$ (The smart one) had seen someone sulking near by and went to check it out. After which, ${Blaja}$ noticed a crate of loose goods, not particularly important, had been stolen and set off after the seeming thief of that crate toward the sewers. Each losing their target to the sewers. But on their return, the crate of loose goods was back and the crate of ${Power Crystals}$ had gone missing.\n\nHeading back to inquire about the gallery as the others continued looking around, ${Norwind}$ spoke with ${Sarana}$ and learned that ${Remela}$ is known to the guild and that she has her own connections and wouldn't likely steal from the guild. He also learned that she had a scrying device of some kind that was powered by a Blue and a Green ${Power Crystal}$, and that both had been broken, ${Sarana}$ accusing his group of being the cause from dispelling her ${Scry}$, but she quickly forgave the issue at learning of the other ${Scry}$ ball that had been near by but could offer no information on it as the ${Crystal Ball}$ she used with her device was only good for looking and had no idea of \"recording\".\n\nOn getting back, ${Xylaris}$ had caught wind of a kid she vaguely recognized lurking by the warehouse and snuck off after him as he disappeared. Tryign to follow him, she lost him on the corner, but ${Bottle Bob}$ drunkenly attempted to befriend her with soem convinient information, but gave up on realizing she was at least currently mute and gestured that her prey had ditched her by scaling the wall and scurrying across rooftops. On getting back to the group, ${Xylaris}$ spent a few moments playing Gestures to tell the group what she had seen, prompting ${Torinn}$ to use ${Dispell Magic}$ to free her from her silence. However after discussing and tryign to recall faces, neither could quite remember the faces of the children ${Xylaris}$ had been hanging out with at the orphanage, but they knew them to be linked.\n\nReaching the orphanage, they noted it seemed closed and headed in to speak with someone, learning that the kids were in for the night. Persisting, they spoke with ${Alaronzo}$ and ${Badova}$ and they noted that they would be keeping a close eye on ${Ephlio}$, a young elf who seemed quite fidgetty but wouldn't say what was happening. Notably however, ${Torinn}$ had a bit of a debate with both as they would not let him speak with the children himself, even though he had managed to scare a few of them into seeming guilty of something, but neither of the two administrators were concerned with his fears of the guild or their client. Mistress ${Badova}$ standign her ground and quite confident they would be fine, having dealt with the guild before in such matters.\n\nAs ${Torinn}$ negotiated inside, the rest setup a perimeter, keeping a steady eye on the orphanage to watch for the children slipping out in the cover of night. ${Torinn}$ heading to the brothel to unwind having somewhat lost track of where his compatriots had gone and a bit dismayed by the stuborness of the orphanage's management as the night settled in and the others kept watch. ${Orla}$ soon seeing 5 small children sneak out on a rope of bedsheets swinging across the side of the building and slipping down the side of an adjacent building, the 3 or them giving chase.\n\nEveryone meeting back up after ${Torinn}$ returned to watch the front door and over heard ${Norwind}$'s \"call\". They managed to catch the group of kids in a public storage locker in the trade quarter, a distinct glow coming from a large locker at the end of the small building.\n\nSneaking in and confronting the kids, ${Orla}$'s ghostly antics lead two to simply pass out and the others to notably be scared briefly before slowly pulling it together. But on talking to the kids, they learned that ${Olang}$ had been artifically aged by the kids toying with scrolls they had stolen from ${Lemuli}$, his shop managing to somehow appear on top of ${Bask}$, one of the halfling children, making it easier for him to grab a few scrolls, and that they needed the crystals so that they could use a different scroll they had fought to steal from ${Lemuli}$ that should un-age ${Olang}$. While talking with them, the kids clearly regretted all the trouble they had caused and the theft of the crystals, returning them to ${Norwind}$ so that he could return them to the guild.\n\nEscorting the children with homes back to their respective families and helping the orphans to sneak back into the orphanage, the group arranged to meet the orphans at the orphanage during breakfast to get the scroll and deal with helping ${Olang}$ so that the kids could peacefully rest and not worry with such matters.\n\nHeading home themselves, they took in the night and a long rest themselves before getting ready to head to the orphanage in the morning for their breakfast dealings...",

			"description": "Waking up aboard the ${Ntanti}$ as the sun rose, the group set about deciding where to go next, largely debating between heading to ${Lurus}$ to try to sell their ill-gotten artwork and investigate the lake for ${Ilerar}$'s crates, or heading to ${Hwand}$ on ${Sulendirida}$ to search for ancient artifacts there and possibly recover the ${Gold and Silver Lined Book}$ that two people seem to want now.\n\nShopping and exploring before heading out, ${Quincy}$ took a moment to stop by one of the local bars, ${Liquidity}$, and spent the night drinking and celebrating, bringing the pressence of ${Dionysus}$ to the bar's taps. A few of the locals spreading the news and it would seem that soon the bar should be a common stop for other clerics of ${Quincy}$'s faith.\n\nWith the bar blessed, ${Quincy}$ found himself with greater knowledge, finding himself blessed with additional spells; ${Locate Creature}$, and ${Commune}$.\n\nOpting to head to ${Sulendirida}$ to search the ruins of ${Hwand}$, the group found immediate help from ${Acrusial}$ as ${Ginnet}$ called him over to assist with some navigation charts, though ${Lucy}$ found herself struggling to arrange everyone as well as she adjusted to the additional crew on board.\n\nReaching ${Sulendirida}$ took some time, but they managed to avoid most of the dangers of the open sea, reaching the high cliffs of the island continent and departing on ${Rowboats}$ to head inland as the crew guarded the boat on the north-eastern coast, and rowing up river.\n\nOn their way up river, they noticed some small rocks scattering down the sides but saw nothing to have caused it. Making use of the ${Night Die}$, ${Quincy}$ learned that there would be dangers at night. Setting up to camp in a ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$ for the night, the skeletons and ${Pixie}$ were left out to keep watch.\n\nOvernight the watchers were ambushed, eventually managing to warn everyone inside and as they explored outside they saw nothing under the cover of darkness, ${Ash}$ using ${Detect Magic}$ to manage to see two invisible animals assailing the ${Larrys}$ and helped everyone else to try to attack them.\n\nThough a struggle, the group maanged to kill one, the other escaping into the shadows. Feeling over the corpse and covering it in mud, the animal was identified as a ${Large Badger}$. They skinned the animal, getting 2 pelts from it, and planned to clean the fur later to see if the invisibility still held, though the corpse had lost its invisibility by the next morning as ${Ash}$ pulled forth another ${Larry}$.\n\nHeading further upstream and looking around they also found a ${Bridge}$ on their way up and stopped near-by to camp. Investigating the area, they found a strange plant that seemed to have unusually unnatural blue viens running through it and noted that the bridge was enchanted with ${Abjuration}$ magic that seemed to be responsible for it being in such a good and clean condition. Checking around further, the plant seemed to be on both sides of the long river with no signs of it on the bridge to explain how it was on both sides.\n\nAttempting to get part of the plant to take with them, they were unable to cut, dig-up, or break the plant, ${Eldith}$ notably cutting herself as she tried to cut the plant with a dagger, its skin smoother and far more resistant to her dagger than she expected. Looking around, ${Pixie}$ managed to make out 2 caves in the distance along paths, one on each side of the river, though they appeared unrelated.\n\nOpting to take the path from the bridge into ${Hwand}$ through the mountains, the ${Ash}$ and ${Eldith}$ took to clearing the path of the overgrowth, making decent time as they made full use of their Cantrips. Reaching a path on the northern side of the river, the group made haste up into the mountains, noting that a storm seemed to be arriving in a couple of days, expecting it to beset the mountains and UmqavumHwand</span> sometime during the evening of ${318 Umqavum 11}$.\n\nAs they traveled the path, further up the mountain, they found a plant similar to the resistant one they found before and managed to get a leaf from the plant, ${Eldith}$ managing to identify the plant as a ${Rithe}$ plant. Not known to be magical or exhibit any of the properties they saw in the other plant.\n\nTaking shelter in the cave, ${Ginnet}$ found a dead ${Baby Great Wyrm}$ in the back of the cave that appeared to be alive if only for a moment in the back of the cave where some of the floor had been seemingly consumed by the beast. Dissecting it, the group didn't manage to make heads or tails of how it died or how it got into the cave, but they managed to learn a bit about the anatomy of the young creatures and managed ${3,,orange}$ teeth out of the ordeal.\n\nAs night started to set in, the group took to setting up camp in the shelter of the cave as the storm started to roll in...",

			"description": "Growing up in the city of ${No Coelevo}$ with your mothers ${Nirfiria}$ and ${Suscena}$. Having spent some time with your father ${Sir Carrio}$, you heard many tales of adventurers and sought out one of your own. At his recommendation and with the blessing of your mothers you set off for ${Montis}$ in search of group with which to adventure.\n\nThere you met ${The Seekers}$ while in ${The Moritorium}$ and found a decent but temporary life with them searching ruins for artifacts, the group seemingly not quite up for the future adventures before them, but you carried on, exploring the idea of the Power Crystals you found more.\n\nIn ${Cocan}$ you made passing friends with a Tiefling but bonded with a ${Qwengela}$, and ${Inteitu}$ over drinks in a small local bar before heading on on an expedition for the arcane society with ${Cumegel}$ to the continent of ${Vatnunda}$.\n\nThere you had your first encounter with death, witnessing a Great Wyrm tear through the expedition camp and 6 people dying in the fry. Keeping your composure and harnessing your skill, you managed to save a few of those people with the help of ${Cumegel}$ by drawing the Wyrm astray as ${Humino}$ took the survivors to safety. Sailing back to ${Tebit}$ with the group, you spent some time with your friends there and then headed to ${Dranous}$.\n\nIn the draconian capitol, you met several people, including a helpful and \"pleasant\" librarian by the name of ${Storvia}$ and an intriguing Ranger by the name of ${Govaria}$. Exploring the city, you found yourself followed and managed to trick them and stalk them yourself, learning that they were slavers as they tried to kidnap you.\n\nTo your rescue were your old friends, ${The Seekers}$ having banded together to hunt the slavers that seemed to go by ${Traghaul}$. Working with the local constable, you also managed to save a many of the slaves they had somehow taken in ${Dranous}$ but the slaver's main vessel managed to get away.\n\nThe next several months were filled with small contracts, traveling the world and making modest sums of money as your skills grew, eventually finding your way back to ${Montis}$ and joining a group heading to ${Sulendirida}$ for ancient artifacts.\n\nHeading out on their boat ${The Estulia}$, you found yourself on their scouting team to seek out the state of the ancient ruins and report back, though your taste for the crew is minimal, the Ranger they hired, ${Foria}$, seemed quite nice, if somewhat too lawful.\n\nWith her on the scouting mission, the barbarian ${Eizato}$ and the fighter ${Sivis}$ wer emuch more bearable as company.\n\nFinding a path that wound through the mountains, your small pose stumbled across a baby great wyrm mysteriously squirming on the ground. And while none of you knew much of the growing behaviors of Great Wyrms, ${Foria}$ was certain the wyrm was in distress and easy pickings. You knew the baby to be worth quite a sum thanks to your time in the Arcane Society and talking with ${Cumegel}$ and convinced everyone to carray the wyrm into a cave for safe keeping.\n\nOnce stowed away, ${Foria}$ convinced everyone to head back and keep an eye on the location to see if any parents appeared, trying to beat the incoming storm.\n\nWaiting to the last minute, your group found themselves caught in the rain, though also fairly certain that the baby was somehow alone. Making it to a cave for shelter and rest, you awoke early the next day with your group and headed back to the cave where the baby was stored, finding it dead and dissected in the back as another group of adventurer's seems to be waking up themselves...",

			"description": "Waking in the morning the grouped headed for the Bazar, did some shopping, and then proceeded on to meet the kids, catching them slightly after breakfast as they lounged on the playground. ${Torinn}$ finding himself swarmed my small children and coerced into performing entertainment once again, the others set off to meet the band of misfits and collect the scroll.\n\nGetting the scroll, the group learned of the cost to actually use it and the depression that the kids seemed to actually have, having not been adopted several times and mourning their mistake that aged ${Olang}$. Disturbed by the cost and the prospect of the kids sacrificing themselves, the group set off to talk to ${Lemuli}$, but ${Norwind}$ made a mental note to himself to look into adopting the children to see if they could be raised to be adventurers like them, the twins being good candidates for helping the guild, but knows he'll have to talk to ${Badova}$ about the adoption.\n\nTalking with ${Lemuli}$ the group gets few answers, the elf being one of few words or cares, though he did almost seem to smile at the return of his scroll. Querying deeper, the group learned that ${Lemuli}$ suspected the children but didn't feel compelled to search farther as the demands of the scroll are extensive and using it requires an uncommon degree of skill. But they do learn that he can offer them transport to ${Reykurax}$ if they retrieve the ${Tome of Inscription}$ for him. A book that is fabled to contain a long passage of text translated into several dozen languages, including ${Ancient}$, that was lost to ${Reykurax}$ with the fall of the ancient civilization.\n\nAgreeing to his offer, the group set out to get ready, learning that time months pass in ${Reykurax}$ compared to seconads in the ${Material Plane}$, though ${Lemuli}$ himself offered little more than that in explaination or preparitive information, seemingly indifferent to if the group succeeded or not, though he did offer ${500,,orange}$G as a \"reward\", but had noted if the group sought to buy the scroll it would be ${60000}$G. A mini-extortion attempt failing as the scroll was rightful ${Lemuli's}$ and the local officials would happily secure its proper return.\n\nPreparing for their adventure, they meditated on their ${Blessed Knowledge}$ and searched for more information and supplies. Notably finding a few things:\n+ A general map of the \"continent\" present in ${Reykurax}$\n+ The realm is filled with a mist that is considered to be the incorporeal spirits of the dead\n+ The city of ${Stjornu}$ lies in the foothills of ${Pain}$, ${Anger}$, and ${Grief}$\n+ The most common damage type notably is ${Necrotic}$\n+ Almost everything is expected to be immune to the physical damages (${Bludgeoning}$, ${Piercing}$, ${Slashing}$, and ${Crushing}$)\n\nWhile doing her research to discover these things, ${Orla}$ also picked up some information on ${Earth Elementals}$, gaining the ability to conjure them with her ${Summon Elemental}$ spell.\n\n${Xylaris}$ took to talking to the local Apothecary, ${Dulolei}$, who she had excitingly offended several years ago, threatening him for free stuff and finding herself slightly outclassed by the wizard. This time however, she sought to smooth over her relations and luckily the elf found her equally entertaining with her shenanigans from before and enjoyed her cup of tea, offering to teach her the more complex ways of alchemy and helping her start to choose her specialization of concocting.\n\nListening around the bars for possibly useful intel ${Norwind}$ didn't find much in the way of use for ${Reykurax}$ but did over hear information about two possible stores of loot;\n+ Most notably that the Arch-Wizad that was captured on ${Galdur}$ still had goodies in his research castle located there that the ${Draconian Army}$ had not managed to fully clear, and due to the risk, had abandoned and left.\n+ But of a more minor and vague note, an expedition group was over heard discussing ${Ancient Prisons}$ along the northern coasts of ${Mikillabellera}$ and ${Lunderipio}$.\n\nTagging along with \nMaterial Plane Time:  Skaparvum 5, 319 9:0:0s\nNorwind</span> but using a less subtle approach, ${Natty}$ had a desire to break some heads in, but curtailed by the lawful nature of their capitol city, she joined a dice game that had 2 idiotic hotheads already losing and managed to start a nice scuffle that let her knock them out and learn about a ${Panther Trade}$, were a few panthers needed shipped with a ${1000,,orange}$G payout for luxious and safe transport for the cats, and while she declined it due to the immediate nature of the request, she did get a business card for ${Tiju's Natures}$.\n\nSearching for useful information himself, ${Torinn}$ sought out useful enchanment information and managed to learn to perform several ${Fire}$ resistance enchantments, adding ${1d6}$, ${1d8}$, or ${1d10}$ of ${Fire}$ resistance to an item, but forcing the item to require attunement.\n\nMeeting up and getting ${Orla's}$ research notes, the group setout for ${Braix's Smithery}$ to ask their friendly blacksmith to ${Silver}$ some of their weapons before setting out once again for ${Lemuli's}$ to travel to ${Reykurax}$.\n\nFollowing the lithe elf into the back of his shop, the rogues caught a glimpse of a small but filled room containing hundreds of scrolls but the fleeting view gave little additional information and the group soon found themselves on a ${Teleportation Circle}$. Attempting to ask a few questions, ${Lemuli}$ simply sent them off, not being a creature of patience.\n\nTheir arrival in ${Syjornu}$ was quick and painless, though ${Orla}$ noticed that there didn't appear to be a corresponding ${Teleportation Circle}$ where they arrived and investigating the area simply revealed the room to be a simple room seemingly inside a temple.\n\nHeading out, they met the city of ${Stjornu}$, many places seemingly hutts built into the ground instead of buildings, however the temple and a near-by shop seemed to be the only \"proper\" buildings around.\n\nExamining the people, an assortment of demons and celestials seemed to explore about with a few humanoids seemingly also from the ${Material Plane}$. The first humanoid they meet is ${Sim}$ who seems to be incharge of the temple and is quite squirrelly, seemingly refusing to answer any question directly and tends to give little to no information when replying. Both seeming to go tired of one another, the gnome set off as the group sought out a near by human who seemed to run a shop.\n\n${Sustia}$ runs the magic shop ${LemSim}$ in ${Stjornu}$ and while a bit dodgey about answering questions about herself, she was a bit more giving with information about the area, though nothing at the time that was too unknown, but the group learned that ${LemSim}$ accepts gold and that she does have a boss somewhere in the ${Material Plane}$ and that her boss is able to procure ${Silver Power Crystals}$, as the group watched her get one and trade a demon for a soul, the demon and his compatriot leaving with said power crystal and ${Sistia}$ using an odd device to seemingly absorb the spirit, leading to their next lesson that spirits are a commodity. Which seemed to work along the same lines as the spirit that followed a celestial into the temple that they had exited earlier.\n\nTalking with the helpful human more, they also learned that lost books are quite common across the continent, though many are simply useless fiction books laying about. But the size of the continent makes it difficult to find a book, let alone a specific one. But many of the books in her opinion are from the free roaming of the ancients in ${Reykurax}$. Snd the spirits tend to hostily gather around the city, forming a make shift wall of problems but once past the open plains of the continent are still hostile but much less dense.\n\nAs they left, ${Sustia}$ noted that the weather seemed to be ${Chained Geists}$ before excusing herself back to work as the group left.\n\nHeading to ${The Crematorium}$ the group met ${Thiya}$, a short tempered halfling who generally dismissed them except to tell them to keep out of trouble in her Inn.\n\nLooking around, the group decided to head south and see the ${Geists}$ for themselves, getting into a heated fight with ${3,,orange}$ of them and learning some basic information:\n+ They hurt\n+ They take less damage from ${Fire}$, ${Lightning}$, and ${Thunder}$\n+ They are immune to ${Necrotic}$\n+ They can compel creature to attack their friends\n+ They have a very high Difficulty Check for the compulsion\n\nDuring the fight, ${Orla}$ used ${Durong's Blessing}$ and managed a decent chunk of damage but was soon after knocked unconscious, as was ${Xylaris}$. Thouogh soon after ${Orla}$ died for slightly longer than briefly but was brought back by ${Torinn}$ and ended the fight with a high level ${Magic Missile}$. Though, her eyes appeared normal once again despite the previous use of the blessing.\n\nInvestigating the areas where the ${Geists}$ had fallen, the group found 3 ${Mysterious Crystals}$ and then headed back to the Inn after collecting them for a long night's rest...",

Everyone else getting to know each other built some trust over a small campfire and learned that they're both heading to ${Hwand}$. After some discussion they both agreed to head to the city together and set off into the storm toward the city.\n\nA several day journey ensued, ${Ash}$ and ${Eldith}$ being struck by some creature or thing, but the group was unable to determine what, and further down running into a thick root growth in the middle of the rock path that ${Foria}$ identified as a plant root, but she couldn'wasn't able to identify the plant, particularly given the size of the root and the thickness of the path. Thouogh she did note that it seemed that something large had died there recently as well.\n\nContinuing down the path, they managed to find a cave near-by and woke-up to the end of the storms and next to the city. Heading into the edge of the city, the group found a small store and searching around found a few maps of the city and looking them over, ${Quincy}$ managed to figure out quite assuredly locations that seem of interest, one of which was what appeared to be the city's Castle. \n\nHeading out, ${Pixie}$ noted that the main looking roads appear mostly clear, thouogh everything else appears vastly overgrown.\n\nIn the main square, they stopped at what seemed to be something like a temple but investigating it ${Quincy}$ felt a strange pressence and was unnerved. Looking around, the group decided to move on, heading down toward the castle.\n\nReaching the turn to enter the castle, the group was confronted with a tall wall of vines and after some inspection decided to investigate the other areas of interest that ${Quincy}$ found in the city.\n\nHeading toward the park, the group looked around and found a building near-by that appeared resistant to the vines, and while clear, the only rooftop entrance seemed to be protected by a ${Purple Field}$.\n\nContemplating flying over the vines and attempting entrance through the roof, ${Ginnet}$ volunteered to sneak through the grass and try to reach a seeming entrance.\n\nLearning from previous issues with illusions, they tied ${Ginnet}$ up with rope and ${Lucy}$, ${Sivis}$, and ${Eizato}$ held the reinforced rope to keep from loosing their small friend. As the small rogue snuck his way through, he heard some small ruffling and close to the door and soon felt a tug, the 3 warriors at the end holding tight as ${Ginnet}$ struggled to keep from sliding back, but managed to daftly cut the rope and sneak into the building.\n\nThe group attempting to reach ${Ginnet}$ found him out of range of ${Message}$ and ${Ginnet}$ attempting to reach the group yelled out out the entrance, find two vines near by that lashed out at him as he found shelter behind a counter.\n\n${Eldith}$ used ${Sending}$ on learning that ${Message}$ didn't work and learned that ${Ginnet}$ was in some trouble but that he had made it to the building.\n\nWorking out a plan, ${Quincy}$, led ${Erilore}$ and ${Lucy}$ in a sprint with ${Freedom of Movement}$, managing to shake the grasp of the vines, however as they ran in they found themselves beset by several lashes from the overgrowth, ${Quincy}$ drawing most of their attention and taking a bit of damage as they worked their way in to join their wayward rogue.\n\nWorking out a plan to deal with the vines, they looked at the ${Lime Crystal}$ and worked out the difficulty of using the crystal was tied to one's ${Wisdom}$ as well as ${Arcana}$ (DC22 - ${Wisdom Modifier}$) and they tried throwing distractions as the wise cleric attempted to use the ${Lime Crystal}$ to get through the ${Green Barrier}$ in the hallway and found himself unable to pass, ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ releasing their distractions and discovering the vine's scary accuracy.\n\nGetting strapped for room and the lashing of the vines begining to damage the foundation, ${Erilore}$ used ${Blight}$ and drove the two vines out, the hallway seeming clear and allowing ${Quincy}$ to set about focusing on getting through the barrier as ${Ginnet}$ took to the door near them. Both eventually getting into the areas.\n\n${Ginnet}$ gaining access to a store room and subsequently a basement, he and the ladies set about exploring and found books and a few ${Silvered Rapiers}$. But nothing else of interest seemed to be down there.\n\nMeanwhile ${Quincy}$ managed into what appeared to be an old cafe with books and some potions and scrolls near-by that he collected along with a book.\n\nWhile their friends dug through the building, ${Eldith}$ took a short rest to attune to her ${Witch's Broom}$ and ${Ash}$ kept a weather eye, noticing that the vines seemed to be moving ever so slightly, he and ${Foria}$ pondered the vines.\n\nFiguring they've explored the building thourghly enough, they ran out from the building, using ${Major Image}$ to create a distraction, but despite the advantage from the noise, they took some hits running out.\n\nSeeking a place for the night, the group found the entrance they came in through closed off with vines and set back toward the cafe like building and gave the warriors ${Fly}$ to lift people into the building entrance and retreat into the seemingly protected building.\n\nLooking around, the group organized and took in their information, solidifying the information they gathered earlier that the building was  coated in ${Abjuration}$ magic which should keep them safe and they set about experimenting and pondering their next move.\n\nImportantly they learned that the ${Lime Crystal}$ will only let a single person through \"Blended\" barriers, ${Purple}$, ${Yellow}$, and ${Cyan}$ barriers. Additionally, that teleportation magics like ${Benign Transposition}$ aren't able to pass through those barriers.\n\nThey all pondered and then took a long rest before setting back out on the town...",

Managing to understand that the souls could be released in some manner, but the process and result vary by the soul stored within.\n\nExploring the town, ${Norwind}$ didn't see much of interest but did manage to witness what seemed to be a deal between 2 ${Demons}$ and their ${Hellhound}$ with 2 ${Ghosts}$, watching 1 ghost leave with a pair of nearby ${Celestials}$ and the other leave with the ${Demons}$, each entering the temple and disappearing in their own way; Demons in a flurry of fire, and Celestials in a flash of light. And while the deal was difficult to make out, the temple seems to be key to changing between realms in someway.\n\nHaving explored the town and ${Orla}$ having recovered from her death, they set out for the ${Plains of Reflection}$, where they knew the land to be peaceful, but would take a little over 2 weeks to reach. Spacing their time out and traveling for 2 days at a time to avoid exhaustion, they managed to rest dealing with the insanity of the empty sky, many managing to keep themselves together as they traveled across the dangerous terrain.\n\nLeaving proved somewhat challenging as \"normal\" ${Geists}$ now seemed to patrol the area, but the group managed to find a way to sneak past, though ${Xylaris}$ found herself in a bit of a jam, but the near-by spirits did not seem to notice.\n\nContinuing their adventure south of the city, the continent seemed mostly peaceful. After 2 days of journeying, they witnessed a ${Large Explosion}$ of what appeared to be lightning in the distance that seemed of note but was East of them and out of the way. Making note of it on their map, they continued south for the ${Plains of Reflection}$.\n\nOn their travels they encountered several Geists and wraiths and mostly avoided them but after running into 2 ${Charged Geists}$, a somewhat familiar air of lightning about them, but as they attempted to avoid the creatures, they found themselves beset by a group of ${Skull Spirits}$ and 2 ${Wraiths}$. Fighting the skulls and wraiths off, they learned that the skulls are quite explosive, each color seemingly unique in its effect:\n+ ${Blue}$: Crystalline in appearance, seems to threaten to ${Freeze}$ those in its explosion.\n+ ${Green}$: Oozing with a foul goo, these have an ${Acidic}$ burn and threaten to ${Curse}$ those in its explosion.\n+ ${Orange}$: Seeming set ablaze, these have an ${Fiery}$ nature have a large and painful explosion.\n\nDuring the fight, they also learned a bit about the ${Wraiths}$, particularly around their ${Claws}$.\n\nHaving survived their encounter, they found a ${Umoya Crystal}$ in the sands and resumed their adventure south. In two separate instances in their travels they stumbled on to a book. And while the first was found and shared with ${Orla}$ who happily took to reading it while riding on ${Torinn's}$ shoulders for the trip, ${Norwind}$ managed to find the other himself and took to reading it in secrecy, and thus far the others have not caught on.\n\nAdditionally on their way south, they notice two distinct pillars in the distance piecing the top of the fog. They made note of what appeared to be their locations and continued south.\n\nEventually the group reached their destination, healing in the light of the ${Plains of Reflection}$ as they set about investigating the area. As they searched, they found the area quite clear of anything that may have been of note, seemingly picked over within the last century or so. However as they explored, they found the spirits uncooperative, seemingly unable to see or hear them, but one seemed to seek them out and introduced himself as ${Volin Aein}$ and he explained that magics or magical items are needed to speak clearly with his compatriots, but the information they seemed to seek was not known to him or any he knew of in the Plains.\n\nTaking the information in and surveying the area, the group decided to head toward a tower and decided to rest up before heading out. Waking up, the depth of the insanity seemed greater and they noted that sleeping in the Plains seemed to increase the potential damage when waking up in the vast void. However, composing themselves, they prepared to head out...",

Leaving through the front, ${Eldith}$ froze a patch of grass by the front door and they all started off running back toward the road. Along the way, they encountered several vines and while the vines have some physical immunities the group managed to slay them with a variety of other damage, including ${Necrotic}$, ${Force}$ and ${Fire}$, though the ${Force}$ damage seemed somewhat muted. \n\nAnd while the physical fighters engaged one vine, the casters engaged another and ${Erilore}$ and ${Ash}$ discovered that some vines seem to have special flowers that appear to absorb magic, but seem to have a limit of absorbing ${1,,orange}$ spell per round and he effect of absorbing the spell is unclear.\n\nAs they continued to run, ${Lucy}$ grabbed a piece of a dead vine for possible use later.\n\nReaching the square, they started up towards another of the ancient buildings that ${Quincy}$ had determined were of note that seemed to be without any overgrowth and with some juggling and thinking, got most of everyone there through flight, either by spell of broom, as ${Lucy}$ navigated the room tops and leapt her way over to the building and in through the front with everyone else.\n\nIn side, the group was confronted with 2 barriers and a door and worked their way through a particularly strong barrier that would shove unwanted guests away, but they soon managed to get their lime crystal as desired and worked their way into  what seemed to be a library, finding a few scrolls of interest and some books for ${Eldith}$ to practice reading, ${Ash}$ finding a scroll of particular note but needing a moment to identify it. ${Ginnet}$ picked the lock to an adjacent closet like room for those in the group less interested in scribbles on a page and found some goodies but not many.\n\nContinuing their exploration of the new building they found the doors to be particularly tricky as well, seeming to seal off after failed attempts at opening them, but determined to get through the doors, ${Ginnet}$ camped out and managed to open the back door that only ${Eldith}$ had succeeded at accessing previously through a pair of particularly nasty ${Purple Barriers}$, and after camping out on the doors for several hours managed to gain access to a kind of storage garage, yielding a number of special items. Though on exploring further, they found a kind of loading door to the area and on opening it found a number of vines camped out, but quickly closed the door, blocking the vines out again.\n\nAs they explored, ${Quincy}$ took a moment to commune with ${Dionysus}$ and asked:\n+ ${@Should we clear out the temple?}$ ${Yes}$\n+ ${@Are there dragons within a dangerous distance of the city?}$ ${No}$\n+ ${@Is the Silver & Gold bound book in the Castle?}$ ${Yes}$\n\nAnd having gained this information, shared it with ${Ash}$, ${Eldith}$, ${Ginnet}$, and ${Lucy}$. However did note the safety from dragons to the others among them.\n\n${Lucy}$ and ${Foria}$ took a moment to look at the piece of the plant that had been retrieved from earlier and examining it with several ${Ranger}$ rituals, she was able to identify it as a ${Referri Vine}$, sharing the knowledge of the vines with everyone around, and everyone seemed to draw a similar conclusion that it must have roots somewhere, suspecting the castle to be the likely residency.\n\nHaving seemingly excavated the building, the group set out to run back to the town square and ended up in a skirmish with vines out in front. After the fight, while heading for the road, ${Ash}$ noticed that there seemed to be part of the building missing as he noted the area's described by his compatriots and compared it to his recollection of the map.\n\nHeading toward the temple, they managed to reach it without any other issues, and prepared to investigate the Temple from ${Quincy's}$ communion.

			"description": "Taking a moment to inspect the temple at which they had arrived, they found a number of quandries with the building. Covered in ${Abjuration}$ and ${Necromantic}$ as well as an unknown type of magic, the building proved almost malicious in nature as the group tried many types of magic and interaction after ${Quincy}$ continued to fell fairly perturbed by the building, though ${Ash}$ seemed fine.\n\nAs they explored the oddly smooth stoned and almost blank building, trying several spells inside and out. ${Firebolt}$ simply being absorbed, but ${Guided Bolt}$ resonating inside, dealing ${Sonic}$ damage to those who were inside and giving a stir to those on the outside. Attempting to carve or physically harm the building seemed to result in a curse, of which ${Lucy}$ found herself afflicted after trying to carve her name into a wall. ${Ash}$ attempted to dispell the magic and found himself resisting some kind of life siphoning magic that took a few additional spell slots with it. While inside, ${Quincy}$ tried blessing a barrel of beer and found that it had turned to a black sludge. ${Mend}$ and ${Lesser Restoration}$ seemed to have no effect, the latter simply causing him to heal himself. With her own idea, ${Erilore}$ tried pricking her finger and rubbing it against the walls and found her blood drained from her, suffering ${Necrotic}$ damage in the process.\n\nExploring the outside, ${Lucy}$ found that there seemed to be a small annex in the back which seemed to have no entrance. ${Ginnet}$ checking inside for hidden doors and then outside trying the ${Potion of Dissolution}$ and finding himself cursed as well. For her part, ${Eldith}$ tried ${Misty Step}$ and found herself thrust backwards from the wall.\n\nTaking in the experience, the group decided to come back to the temple later, deciding instead to head to the Castle.\n\nReaching the vine wall of the Castle, the group arranged a bit and took to the air, managing to get everyone in the air with a bit of a fuss and finding the Castle's roof covered in vines. As they approached, they found what appeared to be a set of front doors and instead opted to head in there.\n\nInside, they found a fluctuating ${Yellow Barrier}$ that seemed to be struggling to stay on and had random holes appear and disappear, but the sides presented seemingly 2 \"Check-In\" desk areas with doors behind them. Dust covering the area as they entered and closed the doors behind them.\n\nDespite the complexities of these locks, ${Ginnet}$ managing to get one of the doors open and they ventured deeper inside through the seemingly secret like tunnel into what seemed to be a chamber once used for storage. Today however it seemed to be filled with mostly deteriorated furniture and dust. Not much seemed to remain of use. Inspecting however, they determined that the occupants were seemingly not terribly bigger than the average humanoid but what seemed to be a \"chair\" of some kind seemed to have quite a bit of room for a tail or for something to coil into it.\n\nTaking their time as they delved into the Castle, they found little of seeming interest, dust and decay seemed to have visited the building and it would seem to have either been well looted or that whoever once lived there had taken their things with them. As they spent the day looking around in the expansive structure, they made note of what seemed to be a ${Grand Bedroom}$, a ${Guard Room}$, and the ${Kitchen}$. And having exhausted the day, consulted the ${Night Die}$ as they set about sleeping in the notable bedroom and found it quite safe.\n\nThey awoke and took note of the room again as the building seemed to creak with odd noises. Taking a moment in the morning, ${Quincy}$ took a moment to ${Commune}$ with ${Dionysus}$ and asked ${3,,orange}$ questions:  \n+ ${@Is the book we seek hidden?}$ ${Yes}$\n+ ${@Can we learn about the magic in the temple within the Castle?}$ ${No}$\n+ ${@Does the castle have a magical barrier specifically protecting it from the vines?}$ ${No}$\n\nSomewhat disappointed by the last 2 answers, he shared what he learned with the group.\n\nLooking more closely in the bedroom than they had before when they had the prospect of several dozen rooms and hallways to inspect, they managed to find 2 well hidden secret entrances, each seeming to lead to another bedroom, but one had an adventure in store as ${Ginnet}$ and ${Quincy}$ smelled a sweet rosemary & cinnamon small near the wall. Curious, they had ${Lucy}$ break through the wall, who found herself charging through a weakened beam of some sort of importance that led to the tunnel's floor collapsing beneath them.\n\nAs they gathered themselves below, they found that a room they had not seem before had become exposed, and a few ventured inside to find a seeming alchemy lab with no entrances. Inside they found a number of supplies and noticed that a few potions or ingredients had spilled across the floor and seemed to be responsible for the weakened floor. As they finished going through the secret doors, ${Ginnet}$ managed to catch the door as it resealed, noticing that the doors seemed to ${Mend}$ themselves shut in some cases. The general state of the building seeming to indicate that the times when they haven't may be tied to the general decay of the building.\n\nStopping next by the kitchen, they managed to find an enclosed box that had a combination lock that they recognized with a grid of colors that seemed to need solved. Hearing a few things rattling around inside, they took the box with them, frustrated with its confusing lock.\n\nKnowing some tricks with the secret doors, they set out toward the ${Guard Room}$ and while mostly empty, they managed to find one such door and a spiral staircase heading deep into the ground. ${Eldith}$ toying with the kitchen box as they began their descent...",

Knowing of two towers, one to the East and one to the West, as well as several \"peaceful\" locations on the continent, the group decided to head Northwest to the ${Foothills of Grief}$. Opting for a seemingly safe path and deciding not to stop by the city.\n\nAs they traveled, their first few days  they managed to find a lost journal. Using ${Comprehend Languages}$, ${Orla}$ began started reading the journal and learned it was the journal of a treasure hunter, or digger, who had ventured to ${Reykurax}$ from the ${Fey Wild}$ in search of treasure and found notes about ancient celebrity tombs, their guards, their traps, and their riches.\n\nBefore managing a long rest, they also encountered a group of ${Wraiths}$ and managed to somewhat avoid them but found themselves being followed. ${Norwind}$ dropped back to try to get behind them but found himself caught in the open. In the ensuing fight, ${Norwind}$ was caught and killed by the ${Wraiths}$ as the rest of the group rushed to his aid.\n\nAs they charged, they watched as a ${Wraith}$ sucked the soul from ${Norwind}$. Winning the fight and killing the ${Wraith}$ that stole ${Norwind's}$ soul, 2 ${Umoya Crystals}$ seemed to fall from it. ${Orla}$ opened one of the ${Umoya Crystals}$ with a successful ${Arcana Check}$ and managed to restore ${Norwind's}$ soul, though his body was worse for wear.\n\nAs they rested for the night, they noted that one ${Wraith}$ was missing from the group, working out a watch schedule as the ${Nightdie}$ said the night would pose a threat.\n\nAs ${Norwind}$ kept watch, he caught wind of the ${Wraiths}$ approach and they manage to slay the ${Wraith}$ leaving ${Torinn}$ and ${Orla}$ to rest through the night.\n\nThe next several days were fairly uneventful as they managed to stealth by any traveling malicious spirits, seeing more than the occasional lost soul wandering the vast plains of the continent. ${Orla}$ continuing to travel of ${Torinn's}$ back and read the ${Unknown Ancient Books}$ they have collected. ${Norwind}$ continuing to read his own book in secret with his spare hours of sleep from using ${Trace}$. Neither near being able to read the language, but both slowly coming to recognize the syllabary of the language.\n\nAs they neared the foothills, they were beset by a group of ${Vengeful Skulls}$, sending nearly everyone unconscious and leaving ${Torinn}$ to revive them. However, the fight seemed to draw the attention of other near-by spirits.\n\nStruggling with the sand and weak from the prior battle, they find themselves in another battle, driving ${Orla}$ to use ${Durong's Blessing}$ again before she and ${Torinn}$ fell unconscious in battle, revived by the others as they retreated to safety and planned to sleep in the safty of ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$.\n\nAs they worked out sleeping, they attempted to make time to meditate on their ${Blessed Knowledge}$, using their pillows in the hopes of getting time to meditate while in the safety of the hut, as they would not have the peacefulness needed to meditate for sometime otherwise.\n\n${Norwind}$ and ${Natty}$ managing to find the time to meditate as the others slept to recover, though their rush to meditate may have hindered their ability to reflect.\n\nAs they finished their contemplations and the others began to wake, the group quickly prepared themselves for whatever may await them on the other side of the hut...",

			"description": "Waking up they found a group of ${Spirits}$ near by and tried to avoid them, but found themselves confronted by a small group of ${Angry Spirits}$ from that pack. Fighting the spirits, they drew the attention of a few more, but managed to dispatch them as well, ${Norwind}$ spotting a book in the distance, he and ${Torinn}$ playing football with ${Orla}$ so she could grab the book and add it to her collection.\n\nReturning to their travels, ${Orla}$ and ${Norwind}$ worked on their usual reading of ${Unknown Ancient Books}$ and ${Orla}$ read more from the ${Digger's Journal}$, learning a bit more about ${Ancient Tombs}$.\n\nAs they traveled, they stumbled across a purple patch of dirt in the foothills, part of the group wandering mindlessly into the soil and taking damage before hopping back out. Leaving the group pondering the ground and staring at a strange purple flower in the middle of the odd square patch.\n\nLooking around, they tried several ways of removing the flower:  \n+ ${Orla's}$, attempting to not touch the soil, used ${Mage Hand}$ but the hand dispursed on touch and a dark purple arc of lightning struck her dealing ${Necrotic}$ damage.\n+ Flustered, ${Orla}$ used ${Fly}$ and tried to use ${Torinn's}$ shovel, however she again suffered ${Necrotic}$ damage and also dropped ${Hector}$ into the purple soil.\n+ Attempting some creative digging, she tried ${Torinn's}$ Trident. However the purple necrotic lightning jumped to ${Torinn}$ and ${Orla}$. Recalling the Trident did not retrieve the flower even though it would recall a fish it had stabbed from the water.\n+ Bestowing ${Torinn}$ with ${Fly}$, he flew over and suffering ${Necrotic}$ damage, he dug out the flower and brought it over ot the group on the shovel.\n\nWith the flower near-by, ${Xylaris}$ took a flask and with ${Natty's}$ help cut the flower delicately into the flask. The group working out that the flower was dangerous to be in contact with from ${Torinn's}$ trip, the potion flasks seemingly capable of holding the flower safely.\n\nCurious of the soil without the flower, ${Orla}$ slowly worked her way over to the patch of soil, and while somewhat distraught from the previous ordeal, she struggled to just lightly touch the soil, but was also \"teased\" by ${Torinn}$, pushing her into the patch to scare her, but her current lack of coordination and a bit of a harder push than intended, sent ${Orla}$ face first into the soil and struggling in the patch she passed out. And while she was quickly pulled out and revived, she angrily descended on ${Torinn}$ for the push, though everyone was mostly healed up after as now both he and ${Orla}$ were low on health.\n\nTheir argument however seemed to draw in other spirits, but during the ensuing fight, ${Norwind}$ spotted a glint in a somewhat far away patch of soil, and requesting ${Fly}$ for himself, dashing over through the air and past a dozen skulls to it to grab it, seeing a number of other spirits of various types on their way to where the group was, seemingly drawn to the area by a loud noise such as a ${Fireball}$ explosion. Grabbing the book with less dexterity than usual, he too suffered the touch of ${Necrotic}$ caress, but managed to get back, meeting the group to the south with a new ${Unknown Ancient Book}$ in tow.\n\nSearching around the ${Foothills of Gried}$, the group did not find much, but the area seemed peaceful enough, though the group found themselves slightly depressed, ${Natty}$ laying on the ground and staring into the empty void of a sky.\n\nUsing the peacefulness, they meditated on their ${Blessed Knowledge}$ and took the time to rest, finding that this area had a similar effect to the ${Plains of Reflection}$ but they woke and worked on deciding where to go, pondering a possible location of a tomb or heading back to town, or heading to the ${Path of Vengence}$.\n\nA top a hill, ${Xylaris}$ surveyed the area with a ${Spyglass}$ and saw several packs of ${Wraiths}$ hunting spirits in the northern plains, seeing several ${Wandering Spirits}$ getting consumed by the ${Wraiths}$. To the south back in the plains, it seemed clear. To the East, there were a number of spirits, all seemingly on a pigrimage or migration of such, some seeming to come to the location:players:ravenFoothills of Grief</span> were they were or possibly heading elsewhere in the mountains. To the West however was seemingly frightening, an apocolypic like cloud in the area that she was able to make out through the spyglass and watched as seemingly hundreds of ${Wandering Spirits}$ were snuffed out by a large firey fist from the ${Path of Vengence}$, the location seemingly frightening.\n\nThus they decided to head to town to possibly investigate getting ${Elixirs of Morletum}$ to help speak with the ghosts and for a moment of peace and investigation without the weight of guilt and grief.\n\nNow on the open plains, the group looped back around and hurriedly rushed back to town. Finding it surrounded by ${Wraiths}$, they took the time to rest far away and snuck past in the morning.\n\nIn town, they headed back to ${LemSim's}$, shopping and pondering what to do. ${Xylaris}$ spent some time talking to her new friend ${Sustia}$, learning about the strange purple flower, the ${Daua Flower}$ and asked about brewing a 3 day potion. Running it by the group, everyone was okay with it and they settled in for a bit of a stay while waiting for the brew.\n\n${Xylaris}$ took to shadowing ${Sustia}$, sniffing a batch of ${Bulwark Bread}$ in an attempt to learn the recipe and found herself with what seemed to be the general ingredients but will be very difficult to brew.\n\n${Orla}$ and ${Norwind}$ set about studying their books. ${Norwind}$ focusing on learning the symbols used by the ${Ancients}$ while ${Orla}$ finished the ${Digger's Journal}$ and did some skimming of ${Unknown Ancient Books}$, though she found herself interrupted for a day thanks to ${Natty}$, who had stumbled across a seemingly stray ghost kitty she later learned to be named ${Snacks}$.\n\nHaving later been awoken by ${Snacks}$ and hearing him talk, ${Natty}$ fed the hungry spirit and sought out ${Orla}$ for assistance, and they talked for a moment and schemed to get ${Snacks}$ to talk to spirits for them as he said he could talk to other ghosts, but as they finished forming their plan, ${Snacks}$ disappeared, seemingly done with the bag of food ${Orla}$ had left. Later, ${Natty}$ found herself with 3 cats as the familiar paw of ${Snacks}$ prodded her face, 2 new furballs were using her hand for pets and her body for comfortable warmth. Now distraught, ${Natty}$ went out seeking assistance with the new found furballs, the one sleeping on her seeming ghostily glued to her shoulder and passed out.\n\nCatching the eye of ${Thiya}$, the small halfing snapped and pulled the trio in line, berating them for being pushy. The three cats seeming to take the message and deciding to leave ${Natty}$ alone, if at least for a while. Talking with ${Thiya}$, ${Natty}$ did catch that the trio were sort of siblings and that you can earn their friendship to be able to call out for them without them being as pushy, mentioning that ${Commf}$ will bestow a stone to those they like. ${Natty}$ finally managing a full night's rest as ${Orla}$ found herself ruffled by ${Snacks}$ digging around in the bag of food the had thrown together in the mess that was her new research area. And while she tried to talk ${Snacks}$ into talking to ghosts for them, the black ghostly cat quickly disappeared, seemingly highly uninterested in her offer.\n\n${Torinn}$ spent the few days resting, attuning and gaining charges for the ${Soul Speech Amulet}$, that would let him more openly speak with spirits. After gaining a charge, he set about speaking with them and pondering the talks.\n\n${Torinn's}$ first ghost was a seemingly old and crazed human that thought ${Torinn}$ a ghost. Talking with the spirit, ${Torinn}$ learned that the ghost seemed to be from 200 years after the ancient kingdoms had fallen and that while he could see ${Torinn}$ there didn't actually seem to be much of anything else around, and while this seemed to phase the ghost somewhat, he simply dismissed the incongruence and resumed talking with this ghost that had found him. While talking, ${Torinn}$ also learned that spirits name to be ${Griffin Fellborn}$ and that he was in ${Hintobin}$, a place of some kind that the group knows nothing of, but before any more answers could be found, ${Torinn}$ lost his connection with ${Griffin}$.\n\nThe next day of ghost conversations found a more shifty spirit. ${Torinn}$ again seemed to appear as a ghost, but this spirits used to be an adventurer of sorts and was fairly distrusting of randomly appearing ghosts. And while they talked, not much was learned, but ${Torinn}$ did gather that the spirit was from after the fall of the ancient kingdoms and learned that royal families tended to end up with collections of ancient books.\n\nAfter managing some rest for the night, the group got together in ${The Crematorium's}$ tavern, grabbed some food, and got ready to set out...",

To the west there was a shimmering barrier, seemingly composed of several different color barriers. To the east, they found a kind of counter-top and a storage room.\n\nExploring the storage room, they found a shimmering white armor piece hanging on a wall along with around a dozen crates. ${Ginnet}$ looking over the area determined that there were traps of some sort present but not sure what those traps would be.\n\nVenturing in, he found that there were seamless tiles on the floor that would depress and trigger a radiant sphere to appear above the tile and erupt in a bright flash of ${Radiant}$ damage, making out that it seemed quite powerful (${10,,orange}$d10) but easy enouogh to dodge when you're expecting it (DC${10,,orange}$).\n\nLooking through a crate, they found the tops seemed to be somewhat sealed, and opening one found ${Blue Power Crystals}$ and ${Green Power Crystals}$ inside in a decent quantity, but found that it was depressed into one of the trap tiles. To get it out, ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ wrapped the crate with rope and yanked it out from the room, a few crystals falling from the unsealed top and getting caught in the radiant trap from the tile, starting a chain reaction of explosions that those inside barely escaped. Searching the remains of the room, everything seemed destroyed except the white armor that was inside.\n\nLeaving the storage area and exploring the rest of that side of the basement, they found a pile of skeletons in a corner. Using ${Speak with the Dead}$ to inquire with the skeletons, ${Quincy}$ took a moment to ask a few questions of two of the skeletons in the corner:\n\nThe First Skeleton:  \n+ ${@What year do you think it is?}$ ${1234}$\n+ ${@How are you hiding from?}$ ${The Invaders}$\n+ ${@Who are the invaders?}$ ${The Criminals}$\n+ ${@How do you deactivate the barrier?}$ ${That is handled by the King's Guard}$\n\nThe Second Skeleton:  \n+ <span class=\"rs-lightblue\">What does the <span class=\"fab fa-type3\"></span> symbol on the armor for?</span> ${The Vindica}$\n+ ${@Were the criminals snake people?}$ ${Some}$\n+ ${@Who was the king's guard?}$ ${Those who protected the king}$\n+ ${@How did the King's Guard get through the barrier?}$ ${I'm not sure}$\n\nWith the information in hand, they turned the skeletons over to ${Ash}$ to bulk up his army and headed toward the barrier.\n\nReaching the barrier, ${Eldith}$ took a Red, Blue, and Green power crystal and managed to pass into the barrier. On the otherside she found herself beset by several vines and quickly retreated back through, short a little health from the encounter but managed to note a hole in the ground and an odd terminal on the other side of the room.\n\nSneaking through, ${Ginnet}$ managed to slip into the room without drawing attention and set about going over to the terminal, finding a low yellow glow on part of it and 2 insets for power crystals. Experimenting with a few combinations, he set in a Blue and a Green crystal and the terminal seemed to accept the crystals, seal, and shutdown the barrier, letting the others in.\n\nFighting the vines in the room, the group eventually settled on ignoring the vines and descending into the hole in the ground, following the trio of roots that came up through the floor. Fighting off a few vines, they worked their way into a hallway or cave and prepared to approach the seeming origin of at least some fo the vines in the city...\n\n[Rewritten after information overwritten]",

As they started to get into position and pruned the last flower, they tested and noted that the flowers have a small area in which they can absorb spells, seeming to at least be ${4,,orange}$ studs in radius.\n\nWith the last flower pruned, the group found the plant much more animated as it heaved its roots and collapsed the passages, trapping the group inside until they could dig their way out. More vines sprouting forth from the group and threatening several members, most notable ${Quincy}$, who found himself alone and flanked by the vines.\n\nIn response, ${Quincy}$ set upon the plant with ${Hold Monster}$, the spell seeming to bind the plant from moving as the rest of the group sought to deal with the vines and remaining flowers that were on the plant itself.\n\n${Lucy}$ set about protecting ${Eldith}$ and ${Erilore}$ where a vine had sprung as they and ${Ash}$ set about throwing spells at the flowers on the newly sprung vines.\n\nDagger in hand, ${Ginnet}$ set to pruning the flowers from the paralyzed plant. Managing to go through quite a few before the plant managed to free itself from ${Quincy's}$ spell, many others having joined ${Ginnet}$ in preparation from finishing the plant off.\n\nNow free of the hold, the plant was able to flourish, swinging its barbed leaves at those around it. With enough flowers in place to protect it from spells, the casters retreated a bit, trying to stay in range, and found the leaves still reached, but hurt much less.\n\nThe others in the party along with ${Ash's Skeletons}$, struggled with several vines, but kept them occupied as the spell casters quickly killed the plant with ${Blight}$, the vines seeming to kill over a round later and roots quickly toppling and the roots quickly showing signs of decay.\n\nThe plant seemingly dead, the group searched the room and found 4 ${Orange Power Crystals}$ and the ${Silver and Gold Trim Book}$ they sought. And looking further, ${Quincy}$ noted that seeming cave they were in used to be a room of some kind, though its purpose or past look are unrecognizable at this point. Others in the group had concerns about there being other plants, but they all generally agreed the place they were in was safe enough to rest.\n\nWaking up, they set about leaving the area, using the ${Potion of Dissolution}$ to make quick work of a pile of rubble to investigate an unexplored path, finding that 3 of the roots went to the same place, the 3 roots they had seen in the lab prior. Another 2 roots seemed to disappear into the ground and they abandoned any notions of following those 2.\n\nLooking around in the Castle one last time, ${Ginnet}$ was suspicious that there was additional treasure hiding somewhere, ${Quincy}$ convinced otherwise convinced ${Ash}$ to toss a coin into a corner for ${Ginnet}$ to find. Though after finding it, the small rogue was further convinced there was more coin to be found but was talked out of the expedition by his peers.\n\nHeading back toward the city, they found the area to seem peaceful. Testing the waters with several illusions spells, they decided the place to be clear.\n\nAs they headed down the street and looked around, ${Sivis}$ noted that they should divvy up the loot, proposing that his group keep the ${Orange Power Crystals}$ and the others take the book. With some cunning, ${Eldith}$ used ${Sending}$ to talk to ${Erilore}$, convinced that the Tiefling was somewhat done with traveling with the smugglers and managed to convince her to join their group, bring her share of the loot, 1 ${Orange Power Crystal}$ with her. So the group agreed to the trade but were against any further split of the loot, ${Lucy}$ and ${Quincy}$ having particularly strong feelings on the matter. Having settled the divvying of the loot, ${Sivis}$, ${Foria}$, and ${Eizato}$ set off north as the group welcomed ${Erilore}$ and discussed their next plans.\n\nWhile discussing next plans, the group quickly concluded that the others might be running ahead to try to scout the newly freed city before them and searched their way north as well, heading to the spots that ${Quincy}$ had noted on the map, splitting into 2 teams to check the northern markers.\n\n${Lucy}$, ${Ash}$, and ${Erilore}$ stop at a building and investigate, finding some items but no sign of the other group. However, ${Quincy}$, ${Eldith}$, and ${Ginnet}$ found themselves in a building that appears to have been investigated very recently, finding several crates opened. As they searched, they found a <span class=\"rs-blue fab fa-typo3\"></span> Symbol in the building and 4 ${Glass Puzzle Boxes}$ that seemed to have sealed in various items:\n+ A Gold Embroidered Tarot Deck\n+ A Red Crystal ball with Black Lightning frozen inside\n+ A Coin Purse with \"Opulence\" Inscribed on it\n+ A Set of additional Alchemy Tools to add to an Alchemist Kit\n\nHowever, with their discoveries in hand, the group continued to other markers, racing to stay ahead of ${Sivis}$ and the others. Each other point seemingly unvisited by the trio. However, as they searched the town, the group noticed a small smoke plume to the north and had ${Pixie}$ investigate from above as they continued to rummage through the town.\n\nReturning, ${Pixie}$ reported that the smoke seemed to be a camp of some kind with dozens of seeming sailors about, maybe 3 miles north of the city.\n\nFinishing their search of the important spots and the day coming to an end, ${Quincy}$ took a moment to ${Commune}$ with ${Dionysus}$:\n+ Is the camp to the north associated with ${Sivis}$ and the others? <span class=\"rs-blue\">Yes</span>\n+ Are they hostile toward us? <span class=\"rs-blue\">Not Currently</span>\n+ Are we safe for the night? <span class=\"rs-blue\">Yes</span>\n\nWith this information in hand, the group took a long rest at their final stop, which seemed to be a magic shop of some kind in a past life.\n\nAs they woke, they set about opening the puzzle boxes they had acquired over their morning meal;\n+ ${Ginnet}$ managing to open the Alchemy Set and the Coin Purse.\n+ ${Eldith}$ opening the Red Crystal Orb\n+ And ${Erilore}$ opening the Tarot Deck\n\nThey admired their new found loot and talked with the group as they began to prepare for the new day...",

			"description": "Fed and ready for a new day, the group did some last minute shopping before heading out after learning that ${LemSim's}$ Inventory had been updated. With new items in tow, they also asked a few last minute questions regarding the ${Lightning Explosion}$ they witnessed a few weeks back, ${Sustia}$ noting that it was likely several large ${Lightning Geists}$ or a powerful wizard, informing the group that powerful wizards aren't unheard of and usually manage a way into the realm without coming into ${Stjornu}$.\n\nLooking at the various routes to their destination and taking into account a warning from ${Sustia}$ about the ${Foothills of Anger}$, they opted for a route through the foothills but trying to spend as little time as possible there.\n\nAs they prepared, ${Norwind}$ taking a moment to experiment with the ghosts wandering around in the town. He let one pass through him as he observed his ${Ipsi}$ doll and noted that the doll seemed to show the effect as a ${Cold}$ version of ${Necromantic}$ magic.\n\nHeading out, sneaking around the ${Wraiths}$ that circled the city and were almost caught before running to the near-by path that was populated by hundreds of ${Lost Souls}$ migrating to and from various places through the mountains. Once on the path, the ${Wraiths}$ that were in pursuit stopped, returning to encircling the city.\n\nUsing the path, the group traveled northward, moving with the near-by spirits until they reached the ${Foothills of Anger}$ where the witnessed several scattered brawling spirits across the terrain.\n\nEntering the area themselves, they felt anger overcome them, striking at each other briefly before getting a handle on their rage and managing to keep their composure through the effect.\n\nTraveling across the foothills, they spotted a book in the distance and retrieved an odd journal apparently written in ${Abyssal}$ that ${Orla}$ was able to read. The journal seeming left by an alchemist who seemed to be studying the odd soil they had encountered previously, noted as ${Necrasoil}$. Flipping through she found mention of the ${Dauoa Flower}$ as well, but needed to return to her spot to finish reading the journal from start to finish to understand it all. Though the book seemed to ultimately contain information for making an elixir to communicate with the dead.\n\nMaking their way across ${Reykurax}$ they spotted an odd cave through the mist near the top of the mountain. Intrigued, they set off to climb the side of the mountain, using ${Fly}$ and ${Xylaris' Climbing Kit}$ to reach the cave.\n\nClimbing the side of the mountain, they noticed several wraiths seemingly hunting around the mountain, but managed to keep a low enough profile and a good enough pace to avoid them as they climbed.\n\nReaching the cave, they spotted 4 ${Wraiths}$ inside seemingly presiding over 4 long dead bodies. With the advantage of surprise, they jumped the wraiths and managed to dispatch them with an unexpected ease. Searching the bodies, they found a ${Moon Tipped Staff}$, a ${Silver Bracelet with a Cat Toy}$, and a ${Dark Green Wand}$. Wanting to learn more about the new found items before descending, ${Orla}$ set about performing ${Identify}$ rituals as the rest of the group watched the cave.\n\nLearning that the staff was obscured by an ${Illusion}$ spell, the group soon learned it was actually a large mace and identified it as ${Ornimentor}$. However, as they set about identifying the wand, the group was attacked by wandering ${Wraiths}$ and managed to defend ${Orla}$ as she performed the ritual but found these ${Wraiths}$ to be as difficult to fight as they would normal expect.\n\nFinishing with the wand which they now knew as ${Dyrio}$, they set off down the side of the mountain, trying to make haste as their spells had been quite expended and ${Xylaris}$ and ${Natty}$ had both suffered extensive injuries.\n\n${Skull Spirits}$ seemed to dot the sky as they descended, but with some cover and with the help of ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ flying off with several ${Sound Bombs}$, they managed to distract the near-by spirits and descend safely.\n\nAt the bottom, they manage some rest, meditation, and finish identifying the items revealing the bracelet to be an anchor for the soul of a cat by the name of ${Meowsaton}$.\n\nResuming their journey, they pass an outlet from the mountain pass and witness a strange interaction of a large spirit pushing his way through the crowd, seemingly unusually aware of the other spirits in the are as he made his way down into the ${Foothills of Anger}$, the group continuing toward the crypt location they had identified from the ${Digger's Journal}$ previously...",

As they finished, ${Ginnet}$ heard laughter behind him, with no one seemingly behind him.\n\nRetrieving the orb in a cloak and shoving it into a bag of holding, the group discussed the items and their plans, opting to head back to the boat, letting ${Stibusix}$ know that they had the book and were on their way back to ${Dranous}$ to meet him.\n\nA several days into their trip to the coast, they noticed that ${Ginnet's}$ bag had begun to smoke and after some digging, ${Ginnet}$ fished out a pair of ${Smoke Bombs}$ and tossed them out into the water, but noticed that his bombs and supplies still seemed to be in order.\n\nBack on the boat, they all settled in and decided to head back to ${Dranous}$, identifying their new items on the way.\n\nLooking at the items, ${Eldith}$ made out that the cursed ones seemed to be haunted by angry spirits. Taking a moment to himself with ${Cognious}$, ${Ash}$ was able to determine that the spirits could possibly be turned to good if they could befriend the spirits, though the details of that were fuzzy and mostly seemed to lean toward learning about the items and their original owners or creators.\n\n${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ took to experimenting with the ${Rurgo's Alchemy Extensions}$ and found it problematic, suspecting that ${Opulence}$ was the problem, they experimented a bit while brewing and determined the source of their issues to be the alchemy extensions instead.\n\n${Erilore}$ took the tarot deck later that night and did a reading while trying to communicate with the spirit and got an impression of death and revenge, though no sense of motives or desires beyond that, such as who.\n\nReaching ${Dranous}$, the group set out to try to reach the draconian royal wizards for help with the items they found, leaving ${Eldith}$ and ${Lucy}$ on the boat to meet with ${Stibusix}$. Talking to the officials there and briefing ${Lar}$ on their situation. While there, the panel in the briefing room seemed to inform ${Lar}$ that they had cursed items on them in the room and while concerned, went on with the briefing. As they talked, they learned the court wizards were all busy with orders from the Queen as the nation found itself dealing with several newly discovered ${Great Wyrms}$ plaguing cities on the continent, specifically:\n+ Neulus Re\n+ Oblidiumba\n+ Creutor\n+ Terna\n+ Tarcer\n+ Bractea\n+ Demar\n\nAs the rest of the group talked in the castle, ${Eldith}$ set about talking to ${Stibusix}$ and gave him the book in exchange for his staff. Their talk was brief and ${Eldith}$ found her read of ${Stibusix}$ odd but he was seemingly well mannered, if in a rush, likely to read the new book.\n\nWaiting for the rest of the group, ${Eldith}$ & ${Lucy}$ set out to the ${Eldith}$ Imperial Library</span> dropping off several ${Unknown Ancient Books}$. While there, they spoke with ${Amavie}$, the head of the library, and ${Bisum}$, one of 2 librarians responsible for the historical section of the library. ${Eldith}$ explained that they may want the books back in the future and ${Amavie}$ noted that should be fine, ${Bisum}$ noting he would make copies to have around should they need them. While there, ${Eldith}$ also managed to find the ritual that ${Erilore}$ had mentioned needing to imbue spells into her blue orb that she keeps around.\n\nAs the day came to a close, the group met up  and managed some shopping before finishing the day at ${Ixa's Pub}$, for a few drinks. Settling in, ${Eldith}$ went behind the pub with ${Pixie}$, both in their cat form as she sought to enjoy new friendships thanks to her new staff but found the cats behind the pub to be extremely aggressive and they attacked both her and ${Pixie}$ en mass before scurrying away after her polymorph ended.\n\nDistraught, ${Eldith}$ returned to the group and grabbed a drink herself as they pondered their next moves. However, as they drank, ${Ash}$ and ${Eldith}$ feeling an odd gaze upon the group but in looking around saw no one of note...",

In the morning, they used their time to plan and shop, settling on visiting the library for more information, including spells such as ${Wind Wall}$ for ${Eldith}$ and ${Haste}$ for ${Ash}$, as well as alchemical recipes such as ${Minor Healing Potion}$ learned by ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$.\n\nAs the others explored the library, ${Quincy}$ and ${Erilore}$ made use of ${Ixa's Pub}$. ${Erilore}$ talking a few people out of some coin, while ${Quincy}$ used his divine connection to look into the lore behind his necklace ${Icy Presence}$, seeing visions of a long past time when the Ancient civilizations still stood, back when the necklace was created and spanning the time until it came to be on his neck.\n\nNew information in hand, they gathered and decided to ${Scry}$ on ${Inrena}$, seeing her with 8 powerful looking warriors and overheard them discussing travel to ${Galdur}$, a place most of the group had been before but was new to ${Ginnet}$ and ${Erilore}$. Bringing them up to speed, the group decided to venture out to ${Galdur}$ and attempt to catch wind of ${Inrena's}$ activities at the least, worried slightly about the people she had in her company. Of note from what ${Eldith}$ saw while scrying however was a ${Gold}$ and ${Silver}$ power crystal on the navigation map they were using. Though there only seemed to be one ship at least.\n\nThey managed to reach ${Galdur}$ without any incident, arriving at night and finding 3 draconian ships anchored off the coast. Rowing ashore, half a dozen guards came to meet them, apparently a patrol from the local draconian army coming to check on the activity and recognizing the group as part of the army. Talking with them, the guards explained that they were with the observatory forces and keeping watch over the castle that had been attacked 2 years prior as the army was unable to hold the island due to the violent creatures and deadly traps scattered around.\n\nTalking with the guards, they noted that one knew the spell ${Sending}$ and would be able to stay in touch with them, and that most of the draconian army would soon be gone with just 1 boat staying near-by to observe the castle.\n\nSleeping on the boat, they returned in the morning to a beach littered with the corpses of large spiders, seemingly a problem from last night for the regiments stationed on the continent. Notably there were no dead soldiers among them and while looking around, ${Quincy}$ noticed what seemed to be smoke to the north.\n\nA soldier on the shore noted that among the large creatures he had heard of on the continent was a large fire slug, but also noted that the Observational Forces had a decent view of the island for about 50 miles, so the smoke was probably farther out than that, but returned to removing the spider corpses as the group set off north.\n\nTraveling north for a few miles, they crossed paths with some kind of lumbering creature or terrain as the ground shook as though something was walking by above them high along the mountain. While ${Pixie}$ had been sent ahead to keep an eye out, ${Eldith}$ noted that her familiar seemed to be gone.\n\nContinuing their path, they kept an open eye as they explored...",

			"description": "With their eyes peeled for possibly goodies as they traveled towards the crypt, the group spotted a set of foot prints and realized that they had not seen any in their time in ${Reykurax}$ outside of town. Looking into the prints, they seemed ordinary enough, but the prints seemed to disappear in the distance, ${Xylaris}$ and ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ finding what seemed to be the end of the trail in the distance.\n\nFollowing what they could to the end, the group looked around and ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ was able to pick up a smell at the end of the trail of foot prints and the group followed her further as she followed the scent, but ended up losing after a few hours in the open plains.\n\nInvestigating the area seemed to reveal nothing, though ${Norwind}$ and ${Torinn}$ struggled slightly with a small chunk of ${Necrasoil}$ hiding under the surface. And while digging, they did uncover that the sands seem to refill holes more than one would expect, to an almost uncannily smooth surface. And while true, their own foot prints appear to persist behind them, there seeming to be some kind of \"limit\" to the size of a hole at which the ground seems to smooth itself out.\n\nFinishing with their inspection of the area where they lost the scent, they returned to heading towards the crypt. Their journey interrupted by a set of ${Chained Geists}$ that they managed to handle swiftly with ${Protection from Good and Evil}$ to protect them from the charm effects of the Geists and ${Orla}$ using ${Durong's Blessing}$ to dispatch them as quickly as possible. Though the fight still proved difficult, with ${Orla}$ being knocked unconscious and the others worse for wear.\n\nTaking a short rest to heal, they barely made it through their meals before they were set upon by ${Skull Spirits}$ exploding in their camp, and seem followed by ${Wraiths}$, which the group managed to flee from, running to exhaustion towards the crypt and taking shelter in ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$ after reading from the ${Night Die}$ that the night would be treacherous. Waking, they found the area peaceful and set about heading toward the crypt once again.\n\nOnce in the area where they believed the crypt should be, they found nothing but an open field. As they prepared to set about digging once more, they noted to check for magic and ${Orla}$ found herself staring at a magical illusionary wall of some sort.\n\nAttempting ${Dispell Magic}$, the spell reflected off the barrier, shocking ${Torinn}$ somewhat to ${Orla's}$ amusement but inflicting no real pain. Going through their options, they tried knocking but found the barrier to be passable. Opting for a more direct approach, ${Norwind}$ simply walked in, finding a vivid and splendid surreal scene on the other side as he collapsed to his knees in awe of the sight before him.\n\nPast the barrier laid a vast and lush green field, filled with trees and grass, glowing runes etched in the sky, seeming to be part of the illusory magic. Birds and other small creatures littered the landscape in the distance and the warmth of the sun felt rejuvenating. A lone marble building stood in the middle. Seemingly carved from a single block of stone, the building seemed to be an entrance to stairs that would head underground. The beauty of its carving and the contrast of its color against the luscious green field and vibrant blue sky  heightening the splendor of the scene before him. As ${Norwind}$ lay upon the grass, he heard not any sound from the others on the other side of the barrier and they all slowly followed in, each taken a back by the sudden transition after nigh months in ${Reykurax}$.\n\nMaintaining some composure and concern for their survival, ${Xylaris}$ and ${Torinn}$ kept their wits enough to notice the backpack leaning against the marble creation as their compatriots sat with their jaws agape, ${Natty}$ seemingly swimming in the grass.\n\nRifling through the bag, they didn't find much of note but were able to make out that it seemed to belong to the ${Digger}$ whose journal they had in their possession. ${Xylaris}$ storing a few seemingly inert potions. The peaceful scenery and warmth of the sun gave the group a fine place to rest as they prepared to explore the crypt.\n\nOpening the crypt's doors, the group was immediately confronted by a ${Wraith}$ that snarled menacingly at them. Though this one appeared different from the wraiths they usually encountered in ${Reykurax}$. This one seemed slightly smaller and instead of the usual claws was holding 2 ${Golden Katanas}$. Charging in, ${Natty}$ set about attacking the creature, though ${Torinn}$ noted trying to speak with it, but the group found the Wraith quite hostile, ${Natty}$ noting that the blades still did ${Necrotic}$ damage as they set about helping her from outside the crypt's doors. ${Xylaris}$ noting that she was unable to study the creature, her mind unable to focus on the creature clearly enough to learn anything about it through her new found sight.\n\nAs they fought, ${Xylaris}$ and ${Norwind}$ both found their daggers difficult to land, both missing the wraith as ${Natty}$ tangled with it in the hallway. ${Orla}$ found herself again attempting to use ${Durong's Blessing}$ and they all noticed as the arcane bolts of ${Magic Missile}$ dispersed at the entryway to the crypt.\n\nWorking their way inside, they found their spells and attacks a bit easier to work with from inside, managing to strike the creature, though even the ${Radiant}$ damage of ${Torinn's}$ invoked ${Spirit Guardians}$ seemed dampened against the Wraith. With the Wraith dispersed, they noted that no crystal seemed to drop and the golden blades seemed to vanish with it.\n\nSearching the area, they noticed more clearly a Red and a Blue door at the end of the hallway and an odd looking redish pedestal around the corner...",

			"description": "As they continued along the path, they again felt a large rumble that they couldn’t identify, making out only that it at least wasn’t a ${Great Wyrm}$, though it did feel similar to the rumble they felt on their way North earlier. Seeking a place to sleep, the ${Night Die}$ indicated the night would be dangerous, leading the group to spend the night inside a Tiny Hut, with ${Pixie}$ on look out.\n\nManaging a long rest, they woke to the sound of wolves as the sun rose out across the sea. Looking around, they decided to head up into a near-by mountain path ~400 studs up a cliff.\n\nUsing a few casts of ${Fly}$ and having ${Lucy}$ carry some people up, they arrived on the path with little to no commotion and managed to see the wide path that ${Pixie}$ had mentioned. Looking up and down the path, it seemed purposefully constructed, but ${Quincy}$ noticed a large paw print on the path, big enough that ${Ginnet}$ could use one of the impressions from the pads as a comfy bed.\n\nTaking stock of the situation, they set off as stealthily as they could manage, continuing North with their eyes peeled for wolves and other creatures and ${Pixie}$ coasting directly above in sight of the group to help keep an eye out.\n\nA few more miles north, ${Quincy}$ caught sight of the paw and noticed large paw prints seeming to straddle them as they went. Stopping, the group looked around, ${Detect Good and Evil}$ revealing the path itself to be evil but no sign of a creature. ${Lucy}$ swinging at the would be legs and finding nothing. ${Ginnet}$ stabbing the path itself and noticing the it bled briefly before his own body coursed with cursed energy, dealing ${Necrotic}$ damage to him.\n\nWith this information in hand, they set about trying to leave the path and found their stomachs sinking as they tried to leave. ${Eldith}$ trying a few different heights on her broom and always finding the feeling when trying to leave. ${Ginnet}$ tries traveling backwards and doesn't find any problems, but does get a good view of ${Eldith}$ pushing past on her broo and vomiting down onto the group.\n\nFor her effort, ${Eldith}$ found herself outside the path and managed to ascertain that the curse deals 6d12 ${Necrotic}$ damage to those trying to leave the path, and caught sight of the smoke further north while she was high enough in the air to see over the sides of the mountains. Everyone else deciding to remain on the path as they continued towards the smoke, ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ entertaining the group with a passable production.\n\nFurther down the path they came across a man with a large war hammer and a smug look as they turned a corener. The man was resting against said hammer off to the side of the path and dismisivly directed them back from whence they came, notably commenting on ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet's}$ dancing, seemingly indicating that he saw them earlier down the path somehow. When asked about leaving the path, he noted that a Castle lay along the path and that they should be able to exit their if they wish.\n\nRetreating back around the corner, the group discussed their options, ${Scry}$ on this new pirate-esq individual or ${Inrena}$, or simply confront this new pirate and push forward toward the smoke.\n\nDeciding to challenge the new found pirate, the group shuffled back, to the dismay of the seeming guard, uttering an odd exclamation under his breathe; \"Flying Bolton\".\n\nQuestioning the would be guard further, he gave little information except that he seemed to be gaurding the path and that none were to pass. Poking around in the back of the group as they questioned him, ${Eldith}$ managed to cast ${True Strike}$, gathering that he had ${205,,orange}$HP, ${20,,orange}$AC, and 8d8 resistance to all damage, unaffected by ${Silvered}$ weapons.\n\nStepping up their efforts, ${Lucy}$ began to pull out her ${Aura Lense}$ to see what magic may be around, and was met with a stern and threatening look from the stranger. Continuing with her decision, the group found themselves beset by archers, 5 arrows landing in ${Lucy's}$ back as she stumbled slightly from the unexpected force. However, the stranger stood steadfast where he was, his war hammer in hand.\n\nDespite the sudden and painful distraction, ${Lucy}$ managed to catch and remember that there was a magical bubble around their new found not-buddy and that all of his equipment seemed enchanted.\n\nAssessing their situation, they gave a hasty retreat, arrows flying around them as they ran back south along the path, the would be anti-friend laughing in the distance, notably not seeming to give chase. As they ran however, they attempted an illusion to draw attention from the more wounded in the group, but those firing the arrows seemed to see through the illusions. The group also speculating from the clustering of the arrows that there may only be one creature using magic to fire from different places.\n\nArrows no longer flying toward the group, they took a moment to rest and contemplated their past dealings, ${Quincy}$ recalling his encounter back in ${Curell}$ with the ${Tiefling}$ and her bow that he recalled she could lose ${5,,orange}$ arrows in one round herself, but inspecting the arrows from ${Lucy's}$ back, they were notably different, seeming to inflict ${Acid}$ damage instead of ${Necrotic}$, amoung a few other design differences.\n\nWhile pondering, they also recalled their promise to ${Ilerar}$ to retrieve crates from the bottom of ${Lake Ricrire}$ and the kidnapped nobles from ${Ascaqua}$ that are presumably somewhere on the Orcish continent of ${Lurus}$. They also remembered the fragment of a frayed coat from their cave explorings for the blessed ancient relics they had found for ${Via}$ early this year.\n\nAs they wrapped up their rest, they contemplated ${Sending}$ to ${Lar}$ or the ${Observational Forces}$ on ${Galdur}$, but opted against it for now.\n\nContemplating sleep, they decided to push through the night for now, hoping to exit the cursed path, but found the path quite open and difficult to avoid threats as a group of wovles got the jump on them. The ensuing fight was not terribly difficult, but strained the group somewhat. ${Lucy}$ and ${Erilore}$ getting ${Lush}$ from ${Quincy's}$ healing brews.\n\nInvestigating a ${Tiny Hutt}$ as an crossing for the edge of the path, they soon abandoned it and continued through the night as they realized that they still had the feeling in their stomachs as they tried to enter the hutt and realized the logistics of staying off the path in the morning.\n\nThrough the night they made good progress, but a wolf seemed to almost stumble into ${Quincy}$, what appeared to be the rest of its pack continuing past the group. Using ${Hold Monster}$, ${Quincy}$ restrained the wolf as the group pondered briefly about what to do before realizing that the wolves were running from something and retreated themselves, finding a location for a ${Tiny Hut}$ for the night and forcing themselves off the path as they prepared for a long rest to heal up, everyone managing to survive the process but not happily.\n\nUsing some extra time, ${Quincy}$ invoked ${Legend Lore}$ upon the ${Ancient Cloak}$, learning that it was worn by someone who seemed to be an aid to the king, noting that many of them seemed to be snake like but also seemed to vary similar to ${Dragonborn}$ or ${Tieflings}$. His vision of the lore shifted through instances of consulting with the royal family and helping to move things around the castle. As the visions continued, the castle appeared to be under attack, guards busily running down hallways and a familiar chaos in the rooms. As his vision came to an end, he saw as the aid, with a dozen others from the castle, retreated into the cellar area and hid where they found the cloak. A bright shining creature of seemingly pure energy the last sight of those in the room, a flash of light the only scene between the aid in the room and ${Quincy}$ seeing himself picking up the cloak.\n\nWorking their way further south down the path, continuing to the Castle mentioned by the stranger, they found themselves beset by birds and found the terrain dangerously angled to send them back toward the path, , ${Erilore}$, ${Quincy}$, and ${Lucy}$ finding themselves back on it at various points, ${Ash}$ and ${Eldith}$ struggling to stay off the path but managing it, despite the birds that ${Lucy}$ drove off with a bellowing yell.\n\nNear the castle, the group took another night's rest in a ${Tiny Hut}$ to venture into the castle with a new day. During their final leg they caught sight of near-by green pastures seemingly occupied by free roamnig live stock on green pastures northwest of them, but also managed to catch sight of the castle's ruined, but still quite functional, walls.\n\nReaching them, ${Eldith}$ noticed her broom ceased to function, ${Quincy}$ no longer a fountain of mist, and ${Lucy's}$ pantsuit lost its glimmer, seemingly dull by comparison. Looking through ${Pixie's}$ eyes, they noticed that the interior of these walls was littered with corpses, many seemingly picked clean and dry, but a few \"fresher\" bodies were around as well.\n\nLooking around the castle walls, they managed to find a spot to grapple over without getting back on the path and climbed over and lowered themselves without terribly much issue. Looking around on the otherside, ${Detect Magic}$ did little more than blind ${Eldith}$ with a bright white glow and the ${Aura Lense}$ was simply blank, even though the command word had not been spoken.\n\nThey took in the seemingly old battle field in front of the castle and pondered their next move...",

			"description": "Taking in the battlefield before them they set about exploring the ruins, noting the destroyed and fallen buildings littering the would be courtyard in front of the still mostly standing castle. The main spire of the castle is imposing and seemingly intact, though the surrounding part has collapsed in several places. The wall around the grounds is partially crumbled along the top but still mostly standing, ranging between ${40,,orange}$ and ${60,,orange}$ studs over all and difficult terrain along the top for most of it.\n\nSearching the area in front of them, ${Eldith}$ and ${Ginnet}$ set about checking the dead bodies. ${Eldith}$ collecting a \"Recent\" and \"Old\" skull for ${Quincy}$ to possibly speak with later. ${Ginnet}$ found all of the bodies missing any useful items such as swords or armor, but many still clad in undergarments and tabards. A portion of the corpses were mangled beyond recognition, and attempting to examine the various causes of death, the damage seemed to range from large canines to small rodents. Talking with the group, ${Eldith}$ used sending to contact one of the ${Draconian Observatory Forces}$ along the shore, and they noted that the castle was and likely still is filled with various dangerous creatures resulting from experiments and noted traps inside the castle as well.\n\nSplitting up to check the courtyard further and check for doors along the walls, ${Eldith}$ and ${Quincy}$ staying against the wall as they walked the perimeter and inspected it. ${Lucy}$, ${Ash}$, and ${Erilore}$ scoping out around the wall but staying part way between the way and ${Ginnet}$ who was busily exploring as best he could around the courtyard but near the group.\n\nAs he checked the various bodies, continuing his examination and hunt for useful or valuable items, ${Ginnet}$ stumbled across someone who still seemed to be hanging onto life. Calling ${Quincy}$ over to heal her, the group took a moment to consider what to do and decided to heal her.\n\nTalking to the newly revived seeming member of the ${Draconian Army}$, they learned her name is ${Statia Custh}$ and that she fell when a large creature broke out from the castle while serving with the 101<sup>st</sup> near the beginning of ${@Bergevum}$. Asking her about the castle, ${Statia}$ didn't seem to have any responsibilities around managing the division, simply following her orders.\n\nFollowing up on the new information, ${Eldith}$ contacted the ${DOF}$ again and confirmed the date was the <span class=\"rs-lightblue\">3<sup>rd</sup> of Unkulevum</span> and that they would need some time to follow up on confirming ${Statia}$ as a member of the army.\n\nContemplating possible exits, they found a partially broken gate to the west, towards where they landed, through which they could escape. Asking ${Statia}$, she pointed out the gate through which she arrived to the North and it was still sealed. However, notably, none of the other gates had paths like the one on which they were traveling. And while the gates were closed, roping over still seemed to be an easy enough option, and the anti-magic field still seemed to be in some effect. Looking around however, and from looking through ${Pixie's}$ eyes, the eastern wall sat atop a fairly tall cliff, that seemed to drop deep into a valley.\n\nDiscussing heading into the Castle to explore, they found 3 entrances in; One fairly sizable but partially collapsed in entrance around the north west part of the castle, and in that same general area they found a window that could possibly scaled into that ${Statia}$ noted bad rumors. Around the southern back part of the castle they found a fairly intact but collapsed closed dark corridor.\n\nNight setting in they contemplated where to sleep, ${Statia}$ noting that the army never slept in the courtyard. Looking back at the corridor, ${Lucy}$ easily cleared the tunnel of debris, but slightly louder than desired. Investigating the tunnel, ${Eldith}$ set off to explore and found it filled with dismembered corpses and organs lining the floor, cieling, and walls of the corridor. The horrific smell overwhelming as a menancing tone seemed to fill the air, something seemingly deep in the castle.\n\nLeaving, they setup to sleep and use ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$ and as ${Eldith}$ looks through ${Pixie's}$ eyes to watch the cleared tunnel she loses her connection and senses that ${Pixie}$ is gone. In the hut however, they take a rest.\n\nAs they sleep, their vision is filled with that of the color blue, a few words from their thoughts echoing:\n+ ${Lucy}$: Dabo de\n+ ${Ash}$: Ass hole\n+ ${Quincy}$: Water Cloak\n+ ${Ginnet}$: Safe & Ocean\n+ ${Eldith}$: Kitten Whiskers\n+ ${Erilore}$: Frigid Bitch\n\nWoken from their slumber, they found themselves in some form of sleep paralysis, staring into the starry night sky, ${Lemuli's Hut}$ seemingly gone and their sense of the time of night or day lost. As they struggled to overcome their paralysis, they found a pair of tiny red dots seemingly floating over them, ${Erilore}$, ${Eldith}$, and ${Quincy}$ the first to break free and set about attacking or escaping whatever beast, apparition, or experiment they seemed to have stumbled across, finding it nigh invulnerable and capable of great pain. ${Erilore}$ dying in the ensuing chaos and trying to flee, only to find the courtyard littered with the floating paired red dots. ${Quincy}$ finding that ${Radiant}$ damage at least seems to drive the creature away and gave them time to regroup.\n\n${Erilore}$ retreating back to the group, they ran for the eastern wall and hurriedly formed a plan to jump and use ${Feather Fall}$ and ${Fly}$ to quickly escape after jumping away from the wall to get clear of the ${Anti-Magic Field}$.\n\nQuickly jumping out as the looming blood curdling screeches seemed to grow near, ${Eldith}$ slipped, hitting her head on the wall, ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ catching her before she could tumble down the wall, however as the only one with ${Fly}$ prepared, the group healed her and found another (or the same) creature upon them, managing to fend it off with divine light from ${Quincy's}$ sword with ${Channel Divinity}$, seemingly uneffected by the ${Anti-Magic Field}$.\n\nGiving a potion to ${Eldith}$they healed the dwarf and jumped, falling through a thin floor of vines and branches, everyone managing to make it to the ground safely, ${Larrys}$ included.\n\nAs they looked around, they took in the forest and realized where they were, having been here several years ago when they set about rescuing the Draconian Arch Wizard ${Crane Vox}$ and that somewhere near by was a small hutt of sorts...",

While returning to the cave, they learned a few new things:  \n+ While the crypt seemed to have \"reset\", the ${Wraiths}$ still seemed present where they had been left\n+ The ${Wraiths}$ are resistant to ${Radiant}$\n+ ${Necrotic}$ damage heals the ${Wraiths}$\n+ The ${Wraiths}$ take full damage from ${Fire}$, ${Cold}$, and ${Thunder}$ seem to deal full damage\n\nReturning to the back of the crypt, ${Orla}$, ${Xylaris}$, and ${Natty}$ worked to shuffle the crystals, letting ${Norwind}$ and ${Torinn}$ into the back area where they found the riddle and the locked door. Searching around, ${Norwind}$ investigated the lock and concluded that a key was definitely needed to open the door.\n\nThe previously opened door with the riddle was now closed with a riddle glowing on it. Approaching the door, ${Torinn}$ believing it to be the same riddle spoke ${The Composer}$ and found himself with a headache, slowly realizing that this time the riddle was in a different language than before. This time it appeared in ${Abyssal}$ instead of ${Primordial}$ and read:  \n<ul>\n<span class=\"rs-lightblue\">\nFollow the river<br/>\nFollow the draft<br/>\nFollow my path<br/>\n</span>\n</ul>\n\nAfter some thought, they considered ${The Crafter}$ as an answer but after some thought realized that the answer was not constricted to the crystal's names and found that \"${Nature}$\" was the answer this time.\n\nNow back in the depths of the cave, ${Norwind}$ and ${Torinn}$ set about exploring the back.\n\nWith the crystals shuffled, the others found themselves in dangerous territory, with ${Orla}$ falling dead and being revived by ${Xylaris}$ with the ${Ring of Osmot}$. With the ${Wraiths}$ dead and the poison cloud finally dispersing after ${3,,orange}$ rounds, the trio breathed a sigh of relief and set about resting, letting ${Torinn}$ know that he could push on now.\n\nIn the depths of the crypt, ${Norwind}$ had worked his way deeper into the crypt, exploring the portals in the back as the others took a short rest. Back there he found two rotating small \"sun dial\" like pieces and noted that they seemed to rotate in quarter turns every so often, though the occurrence appeared random. After sitting for awhile, he toyed with the near-by portals and eventually worked his way into a back room and found himself face to face with a large Golem in a room with a white floor.\n\nReturning through the \"airlock\", ${Torinn}$ ventured back to join ${Norwind}$, but found the back room where the rogue once was empty and 3 portals on. Looking in the room, he too found the rotating wall pieces but did not observe them moving. Looking around, he toyed with the portals and eventually found himself in the same room with the Golem and ${Norwind}$.\n\nSplitting up to search the room with another person there, they found musical notes along the seeming bed in the back of the room while dodging the Golem. Playing the song while dodging the Golem leads to the body on the bed lightly glowing, after which ${Torinn}$ used the ${Soul Speech Amulet}$ and found himself greeted by the spirit;\n\n\"${@What's up little Bolt?}$\"\n",

			"description": "Looking around the dark forest they pondered the lost hutt and started towards the shore, ${Eldith}$ contacting the ${Draconian Observatory Forces}$ and requesting assistance getting back to the base. En route, they found themselves beset by spiders with strangely glowing eyes and found that the they seemed to have some kind of shared resistance, but the spiders themselves were easy enouogh to dispatch. The spiders dead, they continued and ran into the soldiers sent by the ${DOF}$ and on their way back came across a few other dispatched spiders. Arriving at camp, the group immediately sought out rest.\n\nThe morning was greeted with relaxation and ponderings, deciding where to head next and talking with the soldiers in the area. While there, they learned that the remaining divisions were the <span class=\"rs-darkorange\">12<sup>th,</sup></span>, <span class=\"rs-darkorange\">18<sup>th</sup></span>, and the <span class=\"rs-darkorange\">81<sup>st</sup></span>, and that the only one of those with a Captain still alivewas the <span class=\"rs-darkorange\">18<sup>th</sup></span>, by the way of ${Iluka Inayar}$.\n\nTalking to the soldiers in the area, ${Ginnet}$ worked with one of the division chefs to cook up some delicious clam soup that went over well with the soldiers. As they mingled, they learned that the spiders \"condition\" seemed somewhat new, but the mages that could answer the question were off on assignment somewhere else on the island, unknown to the soldiers lounging around the camp. Heading in to talk to the captain, they learned that there were ${Great Wyrms}$ in the area but that they hand managed to kill the few that had attacked the camp and that the beans and other useful scraps from the remains had already been shipped back to ${Draconia}$.\n\nThe group also inquired about getting ${Statia}$ to join them and learned that they'd have to pay her but could probably have her reassigned since the <span class=\"rs-darkorange\">101<sup>st</sup> Division</span> was considered lost and ${Statia}$ was already considered dead. After some talk and consideration her terms which she noted simply wanting picks of the loot found, a place to sleep, and food. Considering it the group agreed and she joined ${ICP}$, Captain ${Iluka}$ noting that he'd handle notifying command.\n\nHeading back out to the boat, they decided make for ${Lurus}$ in an attempt to sell ${Ilerear's Paintings}$, collect his crates, and possibly stop at ${Curell}$ to pick up ${Creara}$ in the hopes of her guiding them across the continent. As they discussed their collective knowledge of ${Lurus}$ they recalled that non-orcs are rarely allowed outside of the capital and even then frowned upon, many being killed on sight. \"Crime\" such as brawls and theft are considered pretty common and likely unreported. But in all, little is known about life on ${Lurus}$ as a whole. Contacting the ranger with sending, ${Eldith}$ arranged for the group to meet her on the docks in 2 and a half weeks and for ${500,,orange}$G up front to discuss their deal. The Orc seemingly wanting to charge ${Eldith}$ for each sending going forward.\n\nPondering their plan, they remembered a few key points about ${Curell}$ and the mark they bare, making it difficult for ${Erilore}$ or ${Statia}$ to follow into the city without arousing suspicion and they'd likely have to stay on the East side of the river where the new incoming refugees tend to reside. However they recalled that outside of the walls, the mark isn't required, but those without it are watched more closely, but getting them inside the walls likely won't work due to the heavy guard pressence. The docks however are outside of the walls and they should be able to meet ${Creara}$ on the West side of the river where the docks reside without much issue from the guards.\n\nAs they traveled, they instated ${Cherub}$ as Quartermaster after ${Statia}$ showed a bit too much interest in the ship's hold, but got her some basic equipment. The journey itself ended up being tight, but peaceful, the group managing to just barely make it to ${Colligus}$ with time to reach ${Curell}$ and meet up with ${Creara}$ when they had planned. On their way, ${Quincy}$ took a moment on several days to commune with ${Dionysus}$ learning a few things:\n+ There are no followers of ${Dionysus}$ or ${Zeus}$ on ${Lurus}$\n+ The local beer is ${Vocatus}$ and it is considered good by ${Dionysus}$\n+ The crates in the lake are not guarded and the locals and government are not aware of them\n+ Ilerare is not aware that ${ICP}$ is in possession of his paintings\n+ The tiefling from ${Curell}$ has been scrying on them\n+ ${Erilore}$ does know some of ${Dionysus}$'s favorite drinks\n+ There are no wanted posters for ${Quincy}$ in ${Curell}$\n\nArriving on the coast of ${Colligus}$, the group prepared to set off across the forest to reach ${Curell}$ and meet up with ${Creara}$...",

			"description": "With the spirit awake and talking, ${Torinn}$, he and ${Norwind}$ struggled to hold off the Golem as they talked to the spirit, whose name they learned was ${Alisco}$.\n\nTalking with the spirit while dodging the attacks of the Golem, they learned his name and got answers to several questions, answering a question for ${Alisco}$ as well...\n\n${Alisco}$ wanted to know how close his crypt was to the edge of the continent, seeming to note that his time was coming to an end after learning the answer.\n\nAs for the group, they had a number of their questions answered, managing to hold ${Alisco}$'s attention, convincing him to let them out, ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$  heading back to let ${Orla}$, ${Natty}$, and ${Xylaris}$ know they can remove the power crystals now, their goal being to shutdown the Golem that ${Alisco}$ seemed to affectionately call ${Crypty}$. A bit of a struggle later, the power crystals were removed and the Golem shut down, all the doors opening seemingly by ${Alisco}$'s will.\n\nWhile ${Torinn}$ spoke with ${Alisco}$ he learned that the spirit was once a bard in service to the King and Queen of the ancient empire, and that he retired into writing relaxing music that became popular among the populace.\n\nAdditionally, ${Alisco}$ seemed to be surprised that they wanted to learn ancient and did not already know it, implying that they seemed to be descendents of the ancients. But they could learn it, and that the ${Tome of Inscriptions}$ would be the best way to do so, and that a copy tended to be kept on every realm the ancients knew visited. The ${Cave of Design}$ typically holding the one for ${Reykurax}$, though probably not a public fact, ${Alisco}$ seemed to think little of the ${Ancient Clerics}$ who was responsible for ${Reykurax}$. Though he also noted that the cave would likely be heavily defended and enchanted.\n\nThe clerics also over saw the dead returning to the ${Material Plane}$ through the ${Path of Ascension}$ where a test of ${Strength}$ is performed followed by a test of ${Will}$ to allow you back into the ${Material Plane}$. Luckily the location of the path, the cave, and also the ${Cave of the Forgotten}$ were noted by ${Alisco}$ on ${Torinn}$'s map. The ${Cave of the Forgotten}$ standing out as another point of interest where the ${Clerics}$ kept a record of the location of passed important people and their tombs.\n\n${Alisco}$ also knew of in ${Reykurax}$, however he also noted 6 citadels were in the realm, 3 as tribute to the Power Crystals and 3 as tribute to emotions, but he didn't recall them himself beyond them existing and them being important to the stabilization of ${Reykurax}$.\n\nAfter talking for sometime, they managed to convince ${Alisco}$ to give them some of his stuff. Revealing his key to them, he allowed them 2 items, noting that now that he was awake, taking more than 2 will lock the crypt and bring forth all the wraiths the crypt can on the chest room.\n\nA long discussion passed as they debated what items to take, opting to take ${Alisco's Songbook}$ in the hopes of finding songs that may achieve similar effects to what ${Alisco's Cello}$ could convey and his ${King's Guard Cloak}$ in the hopes that it would help with the challenges of the path or caves.\n\nBefore leaving, they returned to the bed of the crypt to return the key and say bye to ${Alisco}$, trying one last time to convince ${Alisco}$ to give them his stuff and learning of the realm of ${Comissari}$ where ${Alisco}$ noted he may see them again.\n\nHeading to the nearest suspected citadel, they found the trip oddly devoid of spirits, but did find themselves near the shore where they found a book locked in a security field. Managing to  reading with ${Comprehend Languages}$ they found out it was a journal written by an ${Kenku}$ named ${Carian Lightfoot}$ but they weren't able to identify the language.\n\nReaching the citadel, they found a rune on a circle in front of a door and spent some time experimenting, noticing that when it was touched it faintly glowed purple and that there seemed to be small recessed tunnels around the door, 3 above, 4 below, and 5 on either side.\n\nStanding on the rune, they noticed they could see down the slits and a purple glow came from the base of the tunnels, ${Xylaris}$ noting that she could read a few of them as \"${@Citizen}$\", and after ${Torinn}$ bestowed her with ${Comprehend Languages}$, she knew they all read \"Citizen\" but could not speak or identify the languages, but they collectively determined that speaking the word in the right language shifted the glow from within the tunnel from purple to white and that speaking a word that was not \"Citizen\" in one of the languages seem to incur a great deal of ${Psychic}$ damage after trying to teach ${Xylaris}$ the word in elvish but not well enough.\n\n${Norwind}$ managed to teach ${Orla}$ to speak \"Citizen\" in ${Orcish}$ well enough to light ${9,,orange}$ of the ${17,,orange}$ tunnels.\n\n![doorway](/images/dnd/snapshots/citadeldoor.png)\n\nTop:\n+ [ Unknown ]\n+ [ Unknown ]\n+ ${Primordial}$\n\nLeft Side:\n+ ${Draconic}$\n+ ${Common}$\n+ ${Elvish}$\n+ ${Deep Speech}$\n+ [ Unknown ]\n\nRight Side:\n+ [ Unknown ]\n+ ${Gnomish}$\n+ ${Orc}$\n+ [ Unknown ]\n+ [ Unknown ]\n\nBottom:\n+ [ Unknown ]\n+ [ Unknown ]\n+ ${Infernal}$\n+ ${Abyssal}$\n\nPondering what they knew of the world and legends, they believe ${Dwarven}$ to be one of the missing languages, an old language that is relatively common on the ${Material Plane}$ and also believe that ${Celestial}$ and ${Aquan}$ are other missing languages. ${Celestial}$ being one they've heard in ${Stjornu}$ and that ${Torinn}$ knows of from his old home. ${Aquan}$ being another that they all know of as the language of the old worshippers of ${Whaitiri}$.\n\nTaking in the image and making note of the location of the citadel, they pondered their next adventure...",

AAAAAAAAaaaaaaah!....}$\n\nPondering the answers, the crew had finished preparing the boats and they set off for the shores with ${Ginnet's Carriage}$ in tow. On landing, they stowed the boats on shore and started head towards the mouth of the river to then follow it south to ${Curell}$. As they went, they spent some time discussing and brewing as they rode.\n\n${Lucy}$ spending some time working on creating an Elven  time keeping candle that she had heard of, managing to create a few ${Isikha Candles}$.\n\nWondering if there was a northern entrance into the city, ${Eldith}$ used sending to contact ${Meister Avora}$ who seemed to recall ${Eldith}$ and noted that there was no \"official\" northern entrance or road.\n\nTaking a rest stop a east of the mouth of the river, some of them managed some rest, but many were woken by a ew dozen racoons attempting to raid the carriage, making off with a few rations but many falling to ${Erilore}$ and ${Ginnet}$ as they were keeping watch, ${Eldith}$'s ${Alarm}$ spell waking her in the midst of it. As they defended the carriage, ${Ginnet}$ had taken to using one as a furry mace to drive the others off and found it still alive at the end of the foray. Determined to same the fuzzy creature, ${Eldith}$ took the racoon from him and woke ${Quincy}$, pestering the cleric to heal the wounded creature before setting it free, watching as it quickly scurried back into the woods.\n\nWith the new day, they set out to finish their trip to ${Curell}$. Rounding the shore near the mouth of the river however they found themselves being stalked by guards and noticed several concealed battlements, which they recalled ${Acrusial}$ mentioning that was were the city was likely to start firing. Confronting the guards directly, the group called them over and as they neared, the general impression of the group and the statuing nature of ${Bojangles}$ seemed to leave the guards a bit awe-struck. Talking with the guards, they explained they were simply trying to follow the river to get down to ${Curell}$ and the guards helpfully noted to simple stay a few thousand studs away from the river as they went.\n\nFinishing their adventure south with no issues, they set out to the ${Zaphora Inn}$ where they had stayed previously and got a few rooms for the night at the going rate of 15G per room, which seemed to fluctuate according to the current staff of the night and was seemingly cheaper than when last they were in the city.\n\nThe night stayed quite peaceful, even through ${Lucy's}$ schemings for tricks upon ${Ginnet}$ as she snuck in to find ${Statia}$ and ${Ginnet}$ curled up with ${Ginnet}$ as the \"little\" spoon. Deciding to leave them be, she headed to bed.\n\n${Quincy}$ taking a moment before resting to cast ${Legend Lore}$ on the piece of the tattered coat, learning that ${Holler}$ had created it and that his \"favorite\" Tiefling was the owner.\n\nDawn rising to start the day, they all awoke and grabbed what seemed to pass as breakfast and considered how to pass the last day before meeting with ${Creara}$, deciding to also take a moment to catch up on some needed shopping. ${Lucy}$ & ${Ash}$ setting off for ${Holler's Civvies}$, ${Ginnet}$ & ${Eldith}$ heading for the Castle, and ${Statia}$, ${Erilore}$, and ${Quincy}$ heading for the docks to scout out the area.\n\nAs they reached the inside of the city walls, ${Ginnet}$ set about his own side plan, finding a few ${Urchins}$ out and about and made a deal, trading them some of his items for them to deliver messages to ${Creata}$ in 10 minute intervals. Thuogh the ${Urchins}$ seemed quite cunning, ${Ginnet}$ managed to secure a deal and the trio he had found seemed worth the cost as he watched them organize and head off as he left.\n\n${Ginnet's}$ plan in play, the group set about learning more information and meeting new people...",

The lore obscured by whatever effect was in ${Reykurax}$ affecting ${Divination}$.\n\n${Norwind}$ and ${Orla}$ spending some time reading where they could as everyone kept their eyes open for the ${Wraiths}$ they knew to be in the area.\n\nOne of the nights, they found a sole wraith and ${Norwind}$ and ${Xylaris}$ try to deal with it before it wakes the camp, but find themselves ambushed by the ${Wraith's}$ companions, the group waking to deal with the ${Wraiths}$ and sneak away before more were drawn to the sounds and smell of battle.\n\nContinuing, they eventually reached another citadel, stark black much the same as the other, and stepping on the purple circle they manage to read \"<span class=\"rs-light-blue\">Greed</span>\" in the carvings around the door. But uniquely, a chest filled with ${Umoya Crystals}$ appeared behind the circle. Looking at the chest, thousands of crystals could be seen within. Debating, the group left the crystals alone and watched as it sank into the ground after leaving the circle, no trace of where the chest was coming from or going to where it once was.\n\nSeeking the legend of the ${Citadel of Greed}$ much was learned but no concise answer was found.\n\nWhile on watch over night by the ${Citadel of Greed}$, ${Orla}$ and ${Xylaris}$ managed to catch sight of a peculiarly fat spirit pushing his way through a crowd of lost souls and recognized him as one they had passed earlier on while they were traveling to the crypt, what felt like a month ago. He was a bit too far away to chase after but seemed distinct in the distance, and they made note of the sight and informed everyone in the morning about it.\n\nHeading back to ${Stjornu}$, they did some shopping and on trying to sell their ${Pendant of Cthulhu}$, learned that it was not welcome in the shop, ${Sustia}$ noting that cultists are occasionally found in ${Reykurax}$ being traded by Celestials and Demons, but never arrive of their own accord.\n\nHeading to bed for the night, ${Torinn}$ took a moment to seek out the legend of ${Castupravus}$ and seeing a being traveling the world, though the being itself was blocked from his vision.",

			"description": "Having split up to check the ${Docks}$, ${Hollers}$, and the ${Castle}$, they eventually met up to share their information in the Market.\n\nAt the Docks ${Quincy}$, ${Erilore}$, and ${Statia}$ found a group of exploring adventures having a small party and learned that they called themselves ${The Geishas}$. Talking with them they learned that they had recently felled an adult dragon and were in town to sell its parts and make use of their spoils for the next month in town, notably likely leaving around the <span class=\"rs-lightblue\">20<sup>th</sup> of Dormevum, 318</span>. Their boat nicely docked as workers offloaded the crates of dragon pieces and its former loot. Talking with them at length, they also learned ${The Geishas}$ were willing to train others in the ways of adventuring, meaning they could gain a level in any of their classes (not exceeding level 10) costing 1000G per training. However, as they left, ${Statia}$ had left with their ${Barbarian}$ by the name of ${Horus}$ to look into securing a discount. The trainings they seemed to have were that of a ${Barbarian}$, ${Bard}$, ${Cleric}$, ${Fighter}$, ${Ranger}$, and ${Wizard}$ and would take a week to complete.\n\nAt Hollers Civvies ${Lucy}$ and ${Ash}$ took to talking to ${Holler}$ while the shop was empty and discussing the mysterious house that had been troubling the group. And while ${Holler}$ had been in the city for quite sometime, witnessing the construction of the walls, the building they spoke of predated him. In talking, ${Lucy}$ mentions ${Quincy's}$ run in and ${Holler}$ notes his epiphany as to what the gaurds were looking for several months again, though he had not been directly questioned in regard to it. Though, he did mention that their friends issues and their ${Draconian Army}$ affiliation left him somewhat concerned, but he seemed to be comfortable keeping their information to himself as they saved him from the spider's cave. Looking at the piece of the torn coat, ${Holler}$ seemed to recognize it at least somewhat and noted that there was a special thread used in its construction, provided to him, that helped the wearer use magic, though he knew not the extent as he did not do anything to enchant it.\n\nAt the Castle ${Ginnet}$ and ${Eldith}$ set about talking to the meisters and found the acquaintance ${Evan}$ and ${Univy}$ filling the seats in the public chambers. Talking to them, they learned that the ${Mark of Curell}$ is unique to the person who granted it, but not the creature that bears it. They also learned that use of ${Curell's}$ docks is reserved for those working in service of the city or those of profound special position, such as city founders. Inquiring as work as the group was in need of funds, the meisters noted that a small makeshift village to the south had borrowed 10 important artifacts of ${Curell}$ and was now overrun with large spiders. Offering 5000G for 5 and another 1000G for each after that, the meisters also noted that they would arrange for the ${Caavan of Souls}$ to take them to the village if they were up for the task.\n\nSharing their information back in the market they discussed the possible training and the needed money, deciding that they should take the work from the meisters and head south. Getting drinks in the local temple, they spent a great deal of time into the night, being informed by ${N'orel}$ that the guards, at least for the time, have let go of the \"previous ordeal\". Drinking late into the night, they eventually found ${Creara}$, who noted this was her usual watering hole and sarcastically thanked ${Ginnet}$ for his messages. Talking to ${N'orel}$ about the possessed items he wished them luck and asked that they not leave those items here, seeming to want no part of the possession, but recommended ${Icarn's Invocations}$ as they are better equipped to handle that kind of evil. As they drank, a messenger from the meisters found them and noted that the ${Caravan of Souls}$ will be departing tomorrow night should they still be accepting the artifact retrieval job, handing a description of the artifacts to them as a note from ${Evan}$.\n\n${Erilore}$ and ${Statia}$ spend some time around the Inn as they waited. ${Statia}$ mostly going to sleep after an evening with her new barbarian friend, leaving ${Erilore}$ to her own devices. Taking to the streets, she setup a small table and read fortunes to any who would pay her any heed and got to know a few of the peoples of the city. A well to-do lady did stop and happily listned to ${Erilore's}$ fortune from ${Luck's Future}$ and notably left 200G tip for the reading and rushed off home, the name not quite sticking amoung the dozens of names that proceeded the event, but she remembered the face. She eventually headed back into the inn as ${Quincy}$ and ${Eldith}$ returned from the temple.\n\nOver the night, ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ snope around the \"Forbidden House\" and found themselves talking to the ${Tiefling}$ as she spoke to them from her window, seemingly insulted that their group thinks them so old, seemingly in reference to conversation the group had in private earlier that day. Attempting to recoup the moment, ${Ginnet}$ started to throw his <span class=\"rs-darkorange\">Invigorating Potion<sup><span class=\"fas fa-trademark\"></span></sup></span> at the tiefling but fumbled his throw and while ${Lucy}$ for her part tried to stop him from throwing at all, only helped to confound the fumbled throw, and in the end, they managed only to cover their own feet with the aged \"Potion\" and found the smell as foul as they expected and more. Leaving the teifling laughing in her window, they headed back to the market area that was now mostly empty and managed to wash their boots of the smell before heading back to the inn.\n\nIn the morning, do some shopping and are intrigued in ${Icarn's Incantations}$ as they notice a magnificent swirling potion on the desk, a ${Black Lotus Potion}$ costing 500,000G. They continue their shopping, but ${Ginnet}$ and ${Lucy}$, determined to improve their alchemy (also coin) seek out the creator of the potion after learning that it was brewed locally, eventually stumbling into ${Varn's Vestments}$ and bribing him into noting admitting that a local house that people avoid is known for creating extremely rare items and selling them to shopkeepers to sell for part of the profits. After describing the house in question, they learned it was ${Quincy's}$ favorite house, the same house where the teifling had caught them last night. Inquiring about their possessed items, the enchantress at the shop noted that ${Ginnet}$ has probably found himself quite poor lately noting that ${Opulance}$ siphons coin from the creature holding it and around it provided it reasonably belongs to the creature holding the pouch, but aside from this revelation she wasn't able to provide any additional help. Making note of their findings, they carried on with their shoping.\n\nAs they explored around the market area, the group overheard people talking about a ${Lady Remera}$ and quickly learned that an extremely wealthy noble had recently died, falling from the third floor of her villa while seemingly trying to follow the advice of a fortune teller, leaving untold millions of gold possibly in her villa and her nigh famous servents free to find new employment. Looking around that part of town, the houses were all extremely well off and ${Ginnet's}$ \"past dealings\" left him with a feeling that the houses were well guarded, even in an abandoned state. Listening closely though thye overheard a few nobles that seemed to feel it would take a year for the city to hunt down the late lady's nearest family to have the goods retrieved, noting that they likely had until <span class=\"rs-blue\">20<sup>th</sup> of Unkulevum, 319</span> to snope around the house as the city was likely to use the home and its security to protect the lady's estate instead of trying to move it into a city vault. ${Lucy}$ making a mental note that one of ${Lady Remera's}$ notable treasures was an ornate, and well stocked, ${Spice Rack}$.\n\nJoining the ${Caravan of Souls}$ that evening, their old friend ${Earvin}$ brought them up to speed on the state of the continent; Many more villages and outposts have been destroyed, many of the traveling shopkeeps who traveled with the caravan have left, a few having been killed by deadlier magical beasts seeming to wander the wild. The caravan has taken to bringing ${Anti-Magic}$ fields to help ward off these new beasts. Though with some spacing, they left a gap for ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ to set potions to brew in their carriage as they traveled, the caravan's field possibly interferring with the brewing process. Though everyone found themselves engaged in keeping a watchful eye as they traveled. The stops at some of the places for the caravan gave ${Quincy}$ time to cast ${Legend Lore}$ learning of the legend of ${Opulence}$ and ${Luck's Future}$ but found that ${Rurgo's Alchemy Extensions}$ yielded nothing, seemingly the equipment had no legendary signifigance.\n\nReaching the edge of the village, as close as the ${Caravan of Souls}$ dared to venture, they set off into the trees towards the spider infested area...\n",

As they explored, ${Norwind}$ managed to catch a glimpse of some kind of squid headed humanoid spirit being traded by celestials and demons near the temple, while ${Torinn}$ took some time to gather more legend information on ${The Acheron}$ itself and ${Durong}$. However, while trying to gather information on ${Cthulhu}$, a large migraine overcame him, impairing sight of the lore.\n\nTalking to ${Thiya}$, the shop keep, about the trading and she doesn't know much about the trading that goes on between the celestials and the demons, but it's been going on as long as she's been at the shop.\n\nLeaving town, they headed toward the ${Cave of Design}$ and work their way across the mountains, avoiding the dangers of the more violent spirits in the area as best they could. When they arrive, they find a pitch black wall at the mouth of the cave and pondering for awhile, ${Torinn}$ tried to dispel the darkness but found the energy of his spell cast back at him, barely managing to deflect it. Deciding to return after some rest, they set out into the mountains to find a place to rest before returning to the cave refreshed.\n\nHaving found a cave in which to rest, they awoke to an issue of ${Wraiths}$ seemingly patrolling the area. Using a ${Magic Circle}$, they manage to thwart the wraiths at the entrance of the cave before returning to the ${Cave of Design}$.\n\nOnce back, they set about exploring the cave, reaching in, finding it safe, then sending ${Torinn}$ in on a rope to explore, where he found a raging storm that he seemed to be protected from at the time.\n\nWandering across the vast plains, he found no end in sight, constantly finding the end of the rope as the others hurriedly added more and more rope, though on turning to leave, it took only a brief moment for him to return. Heading back in, he again found the plains almost everlasting though this time the lightning that struck him was quite painful, but after removing the rope and walking forward free of any ties to ${Reykurax}$ he encountered ${Daminoth}$ who spoke to him briefly and bestowed the ${Tome of Inscriptions}$ upon him. The words were fleeting but bore words of warning;  \n\"Be careful what you wrought as history tends to repeat\".\n\nGlancing through the tome it appeared to possess several stories repeated in dozens of languages, allowing one to learn to translate from one language to another, and one of the languages within appeared to be ${Ancient}$. Thouogh, pronunciation of the words seemed omitted from the tome.\n\nTome in tow, they rushed back to town, rushing through the ${Chained Geists}$ surrounding the city of ${Stjornu}$ and took a moment to rest before reading through the tome...\n",

			"description": "Exploring the edge of the seemingly spider infested settlement, they found numerous webs of varying qualities. Suspecting a spider similar to the one they hunted for the ${Meisters}$ of ${Curell}$, ${Quincy}$ used ${Locate Creature}$ and sensed a pressence ahead, though his sense of the location of the creature seemed to jump from one place to another. Sneaking ahead to scout closer to the settlement, ${Ginnet}$ set off in the shadows and on getting closer noticed dozens of spiders in the treetops weaving webs. With his ${Darkvision}$, he managed to make out a building in the distance that seemed to have humanoid creatures inside. Investigating it, he learned the building was locked and that it could easily hold the carriage and horses. The locks seemingly possibly loud in the quiet of the settlement, he rallied with his companions before attempting to gain entry.\n\nSlowly moving their little caravan forward, ${Quincy}$ kept the horse calm as they slowly moved forward, the rest of the group keeping eyes on the spiders above and helping to steady the carriage. Reaching the building, ${Ginnet}$ managed to quietly open the doors and they snuck the carriage inside as ${Ginnet}$ spoke to the woman and 2 children inside, learning her name to be ${Emereta Ringa}$ as the others locked up the building behind them. ${Lucy}$ entertained the kids as the others talked to their mother, learning the the kids seemed slightly disinterested in her chalk, but possibly due to the spiders above and having been very quiet for a long period of time. The others learned of the buildings in the area and a riddle that the mother had passing knowledge of that seemed to serve as a password to access the vault where the artifacts they seek would be stored.\n\nLeaving ${Statia}$ to watch over the mother and the carriage, the others set off to the nearest building, a ${Mysterious House}$. Around the base of the house seemed to be small runes, but they didn't appear to have any magic to them, and on entering they learned it was laid out closer to an inn than a house despite the mother's naming.\n\nInside, they initially seemed to find nothing but spider webs, but toiling they struck they web with a ${Silvered Rapier}$ and the blade simply struck the webbing, the vibration resonating in the air and seeming to lead to the walls stirring. Casting ${Light}$, closer inspection of the walls revealed thousands of baby spiders crawling along the walls, scurrying away from the light and disappearing into small holes in the wall. Investigating the webbing, they set it a flame and noticed that while some of the webbing burned away nicely, other seemingly separate but connected webs did not burn at all.\n\nSearching the rest of the building room by room they found mostly empty, barren, rooms and worked out a strategy of sneaking into a room and closing the door behind them to safely investigate. The next floor up however they found themselves locked in a room with an invisible spider, the mattress of the bed revealing its pressence. The fight was quick after ${Lucy}$ managed to see the creature with her ${Aura Lense}$ and to strike it with a vile of ${Necrotic Puke}$, the vile liquid seeming to harm the creature somewhat but also marking it for the others to get a sense of where the creature was.\n\nAfter slaying the invisible spider, they found a trapped storage cabinet. Mechanical spring-loaded spikes seemed aligned to skewer any who would look into the cabinet uninvited but ${Ginnet}$ managed his way around the traps using ${Mage Hand}$ and found a ${Researcher's Note}$ and a ${Detached Finger}$. Other papers seemed scattered about the room but were notably useless without the author to help order and explain them.\n\nFurther up the building they found a gruesome sight of a torso hanging from webbing by a single arm in the middle of a hallway, his legs severed from the rest of his body leaving his organs scattered about the floor leading up the rest of his corpse, his other arm and head missing. Near-by, an open door gave way to a breeze where that room had a large seemingly 30 stud diameter whole in the ceiling leading to the outside. And while the robe on the torso called for investigation, the shifting forms outside the hole called for concern. Quietly closing the door to the concerning room, they investigated the robe on the torso contained ${6,,orange}$ tiles with letters on them; A, E, G, H, S, and T. Saving them, they finished exploring the non-concerning rooms on the floor and found nothing of interest.\n\nQuietly opening the door again, ${Erilore}$, ${Ginnet}$, and ${Eldith}$ snuck into the concerning room and investigated the area, leaving the others without ${Darkvision}$ at the stairwell. Looking out through the hole, ${Erilore}$ spotted an astoundingly large spider, almost seemingly the size of a small building slowly crawling along the treetops, its weight noticeably bending some of the nearby branches as it strolled across a web. ${Ginnet}$ and ${Eldith}$ having found 1 ring each on 2 bludgeoned corpses that were seemingly smashed into the wall, later discovering them to be ${Rings of Symphony}$ after leaving quietly the room and closing the door.\n\nAs they prepared to head back downstairs to leave, they torched the handing body to kill anything that might be inside, using several magical schools after the webbing survived the flame, making sure there was nothing seemingly left.\n\nAt the door to leave they prepared to sneak into the darkness once again...",

			"description": "Reading through the ${Tome of Inscriptions}$, they started to make some progress in learning ${Ancient}$, slowly piecing together what seemed to be the meaning of several symbols, though the syntax seemed odd and made it difficult to be certain of the translations they believed they had found.\n\nWhile reading and translating was being attempted, ${Torinn}$ took a moment to cast ${Legend Lore}$ and learn more about ${Whaitiri}$, learning of an empire seemingly billions of years ago where she was a queen and used powerful magic to help quide and protect her people and watched as a once peaceful relationship \n\nThe rest of the day was spent shopping, though while out and about ${Natty}$ spotted a ${Celestial}$ trading ${Umoya Crystals}$ with the Inn Keep ${Thiya}$ in a somewhat suspicious manner. Curious, ${Natty}$ followed the celestial around, heading toward ${LimSims}$ where she saw the shopkeep ${Sustia}$ trade the celestial a ${Soul Stone}$ for the crate of crystals. Unsure what to do with the information, ${Natty}$ grabbed ${Torinn}$ from the shop and drug him with her for more information and to possibly confront the creature.\n\nFollowing him, they figured out that he was heading toward the temple, where a number of other celestials and demons seemed to be gathered. Hurriedly trying to figure out what to do, they debated trying to jump it in an alley and on checking him out decided that he may be too much of a challenge to try picking a fight, so ${Natty}$ threw ${Torinn}$ out to talk to the ${Celestial}$.\n\nWhile talking with him, ${Torinn}$ tried to convince the ${Celestial}$ to sell the ${Soul Stone}$ to him and learned that the ${Soul Stones}$ can be used to return a creature to life, but the ${Celestial}$ knew of many more ways that he seemed to quickly dismiss as possibilities for why ${Torinn}$ would want it. In the end however, the ${Celestial}$ seemed to have plaans for the stone that went unshared.\n\nMeeting back up with the group, they discussed their next plans, debating how to learn other languages to enter a Citadel, stay in town and work on learning ${Ancient}$, or headout to the ${Cave of the Forgotten}$. And after some thought, landed on heading to the ${Cave of the Forgotten}$, venturing through the mountains for a more direct, if rocky, route.\n\nManaging to hide their path and avoid the ${Wraiths}$ and ${Skulls}$ in the area, they stumbled across a large waterfall and recalled that it seemed to be the ${Path of Ascension}$ that ${Alisco}$ had described to them  while they were in his tomb.\n\nThe water seemed to be landing atop the peak of a mountain and along the sides and base of the mountain lay dozens, if not hundreds, of wrecked ships in various levels of intact, all seeming patrolled by dozens of ${Wraiths}$ as though it were some kind of hunting or feeding ground. After very little discussion, it was decided that there was lott to be had and they began shuffling their items around to leave with ${Torinn}$ who would serve as a spotter with one ${Sending Stone}$ while the others ventured down, with ${Orla}$ ready to cast ${Fly}$ should they need to run away.\n\nThanks to good spotting from ${Torinn}$ and excellent skulldugery from the rest of the group sneaking around in the wreckage, they managed to avoid the ${Wraiths}$ and find their fill from a few of the more intact ships, deciding to fly back from the top of the mountain where they had managed to find a particularly nice ship that seemed to have some loot too buried to get stealthily but had a few crates they decided to open back with ${Torinn}$ as ${Norwind}$ had suffered quite a few traps while they were in the wreckage, only to be saved by particularly disgusting impromptu brews from ${Xylaris}$ stirring together everything but the kitchen sink to save him from ${Paralysis}$ more than once.\n\nThey did note however that some of the ships were of designs they knew, and some were not, but at least 2 were of ${Draconian}$ design and they found more than 1 <span class=\"rs-darkorange\">Coin of the 5<sup>th</sup> Fleet</span>, which they recalled had been lost while sailing to the aid of ${Qua Silverborn}$.\n\nTaking to the air with their fill of loot, they noticed that the ${Wraiths}$ were quick to notice them and while a few followed beneathe them, the rest rushed towards the place where they took flight, possibly hoping to catch any stragglers or creatures who had been left behind. As they, ${Orla}$ riding on ${Natty's}$ back, one of the crates chomped down on ${Natty's}$ arm, apparently a ${Mimic}$ instead of a crate, almost managing to knock ${Orla}$ unconscious with some kind of poisonous breath before letting go. Seemingly having taken enough punishment and seemingly teleporting after falling a few dozen studs.\n\nBack with ${Torinn}$ they took to retrieving their loot and after some dvying up noticed a large cloud of flaming ${Skulls}$ heading their way, though seemingly unaware of them, but that was only a matter of time. Hurrying their distribution, ${Torinn}$ and ${Xylaris}$ took to taking watch as ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ recalled an old flight herself and took off with a ${Lumen Bomb}$ to cause a distraction in the distance, eventually luring the cloud away to buy them enough time to finish and find a place to rest.\n\nSearching for caves, they found one that seemed decent enough and tried to rest, ${Torinn}$ and ${Xylaris}$ keeping watch, finding several ${Wraiths}$ heading their way and tried to catch them before they would wake anyone in the cave. However their skirmish went awry and they found themselves fighting for their lives, waking the others only after ${Torinn}$ died briefly on the battlefield, saved by ${Xylaris's}$ ${Ring of Osmot}$ and ${Revivify}$.\n\nWith the others awake, they managed to subdue the ${Wraiths}$, finding a few ${Umoya Crystals}$ in their ashes, but awake and exhausted to the point of moving at half speed, they pondered how to get some sleep...",

On their way, ${Ginnet}$ found himself momentarily distracted by what seemed to be the light of a ${Red Power Crystal}$ scurrying across a field in the distance, only to be distracted by other spiders near-by, soon finding themselves set upon by the creatures.\n\nFighting the spiders off, they found the spiders seemed to have seemingly random immunities and a few of the spiders managed to surround themselves in a blue field, one managing to teleport and erupt in a blue ${Cold}$ explosion. Another died while surrounded in its field, exploding and incapacitating ${Lucy}$ for ${266,,orange}$ ${Cold}$ damage after hitting the creature for ${166,,orange}$ damage.\n\nGetting ${Lucy}$ back on her feet, the group fended off the rest of the spiders and retreated to the Temple, avoiding other spiders that were heading their way.\n\nWaiting in the temple, they inspected the building and found it quite simple, no hidden rooms, and only 1 magical enchantment that was found to be a simple megaphone enchantment by ${Eldith}$, if somewhat by accident, leaving them to hold out as the spiders attracted to the noise settled down.\n\nWith the outside settled, they set about sneaking out toward the ${Simple House}$ to search for clues. Inside, they found that half the structure had collapsed on the interior despite the exterior seemingly mostly intact. Inside, they found a corpse strewn across the rubble and managed to to collect some tiles from a lab coat nearby.\n\nInside one of the rooms of the building, they found several cabinets and managed to collect a few notes that seemed important as well as noting a magical enchantment along the floor while searching. Under one of the rugs, they found a trap door leading into an underground room. The room was trapped with thin veneer on the walls that retracted and unleashed a hail of arrows across the room, avoided by hiding in cabinets and moving everyone else out of the room. Inside the basement, they four a laboratory where they found several vials of chemicals and 2 seemingly crystalline spiders, one red, one blue, both in seeming sickly in what appeared to be plain cages.\n\nInvestigating the spiders, the group found that the creatures seemed to pay the party no mind, almost seemingly not seeing them. As ${Ash}$ took a moment to read some nearby notes, learning about ${Red and Blue Crystalline Toxins}$, ${Eldith}$ set about getting drunk and trying to talk to the spiders.\n\nAs ${Eldith}$ tried to talk to the spiders, she found them completely indifferent to her pressence and as she tried to talk to them, found no sign of them hearing her or any replies from them. Trying to inspect the cages in her drunken state she found some magic but couldn't make heads or tails of the magic found it too difficult to explain to ${Ash}$ or ${Erilore}$.\n\nLeaving the basement, they dismissed their light spells and in the darkness ${Ginnet}$ recognized the red glow from the basement as similar to the glows he saw in the field on their way to the temple earlier...",

Waking up, the cave seemed clear and they set off back to town.\n\nOn their way, the next 2 days had several wraiths and skulls go by but as they traveled they noticed that 3 wraiths seemed to be stalking them and only managed some distance as ${Torinn}$ struggled to keep up as he continued to recover from his recent brush with death. Though with some creativity, managed a potion of ${Bull's Strength}$ from his ${Mug of Slightly Limited Bliss}$ and with his own casting of a similar spell, he managed to keep up with the group until he recovered.\n\nOver their days of travel, they seem to lose the Wraiths following them and find a cave in which to rest. The ${Night Die}$ indicates that rest would be dangerous, so ${Orla}$ and ${Xylaris}$ set about keeping watch as the rest of the group rests. While keeping watch, they catch a glimmer of a spyglass in the distance. They keep an eye on it and ponder what it might be but they see no sign of who is using the spyglass and quickly lose sight of the spyglass.\n\nSending ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ out to look for the spyglass, they soon found her on her way back being chased by a cloud of skulls. Everyone waking, they began to prepare for the incoming skulls, ${Norwind}$ spreading out as the others clustered around the cave entrance.\n\nA few moments of discussion preceded as ${Orla}$ decided to retrieve her fluttering companion as ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ struggled to stay ahead of the chasing skulls. Preparing, she enchanted herself with ${Fly}$ and ${Dimension Doored}$ out to the stray bird, returning her to her pocket dimension before going through another door back toward the cave and covering the remaining group with ${Major Image}$. The skulls distracted then lost, seemed to scatter, a few noticing ${Norwind}$ along the mountain side. He managed to dodge most but found himself caught in the caustic sludge of an ${Oozing Skull}$ and while he survived, he found himself cursed, but barably so.\n\nContinuing to venture away from all the noise as ${Wraiths}$ seemed to come from the near-by mountains, they regrouped and managed to keep themselves hidden from the roving packs and eventually made it back to town with no other incidents, running past the heavy and slow ${Charged Geists}$ currently surrounding the town of ${Stjornu}$.\n\nBack in town, they settled in and set about reading and looking at the items they found out in the wreckage. Using the time to let ${Torinn}$ recover, cure ${Norwind}$ of his woes, and meditate on their blessed knowledge.\n\nWhile looking over the tome, they made headway in understanding the ${Ancient}$ language but still found it difficult to comprehend, more \"literal\" or \"direct\" translations seeming elusive.\n\nTaking a moment to slueth around, ${Norwind}$ stalked the edge of the town seeking the ${Spyglass Character}$ he had heard of and somewhat seen during their travels and to inquire with ${Sustia}$ regarding activities in which travelers might find themselves engaged. With no spyglass character found and with ${Sustia}$ seemingly indifferent to the activities of others that did not involve her shop, he seemed to have found little of use.\n\nShopping as they waited, the group stocked up on some basic supplies and ${Torinn}$ took a moment to cast ${Legend Lore}$ to learn more about ${Alisco}$.\n\nAs they waited for ${Torinn}$ to finish recuperating</span>, they prepared to head back out toward the ${Cave of the Forgotten}$...",

As they snuck out, they found a number of spiders near the front entrance and set about checking the back where they seemed to be fewer creatures.\n\nSeeking to thin the herd, they drew in a few other spiders, ${Eldith}$, taking a moment to try to talk with the few outside the window, finds she can't quite understand what they're saying. Luring the spiders into the room through the small window, they set about thinning the herd.\n\nUsing a campfire to act as a door in the window, they let a few spiders in at a time. However, while letting a few in, a crystal spider snuck in, the glow of the campfire obscuring its pressence. Fighting the pink looking crystalline insect, they managed to slay it while i was glowing, a pinkish explosion erupting from it, a fleeting tug on the minds of ${Ginnet}$, ${Lucy}$, and ${Quincy}$ before they fell unconscious. With the campfire up, the rest of the group set about reviving the others and after checking the back and front once more, set out for the overgrown house.\n\nIn the next home, ${Quincy}$ used ${Detect Good and Evil}$ and sensed an evil pressence all around them for as far as he could sense, a sense that lasted for the duration of the spell and allowed him to make out that the spiders were ${Aberrations}$. Creatures not of, or no longer of, this world in some way and with possibly no home realm. Trying to purify the evil, ${Quincy}$ attempted to cast ${Remove Curse}$ but the spell failed to achieve his goal. As he was casting the spell, he sensed a malevolent pressence protecting the desecration of the grounds but he wasn't able to make out what the pressence might be, or if it is even within this realm. Pondering ways to remove it, he noted that ${Dispel Good and Evil}$ may work, but would be difficult. Some way of ${Consecrating}$ the ground would be better, but either may lead to a confrontation with the malevolent entity.\n\nInside the ${Overgrown House}$ they found another body with a particular lab coat that again contained a note and several magical tiles;  \nH, I, I, L, T, T  \nExploring further into the house, they found crushed metal and wood laying around a large room on the top floor, along with a cabinet that had been crushed open by plant growth. Inside the cabinet were 2 notes and the remains of several papers that were illegible. Wrapping up inside, they set off for the ${Damaged House}$.\n\nIn the darkness of the overcasting webs, it was difficult to make out, but once at the home, it was easy to tell that there was no longer an interior to the building. The ground was littered with the remains of maybe a dozen bodies and spiders wandered around the area, though seeming to largely ignore the body parts. Searching the area, they found a ${Thunderous Charm}$ and a lab coat with part of the researcher still inside it, along with several tiles;  \nA, A, E, H, T  \n\nSatisfied with their searching of the area, they set out for the laboratory in the middle of the settlement. Investigating the door, each corner of the large doors sporting a litely glowing rune and it seemed to be magically reinforced in some way. Casting ${Dispel Magic}$ on the 4 runes, each faded away and its mechanical lock was easy prey for ${Ginnet's}$ lock picking skills despite the complexity of it.\n\nAs they entered, the building's interior was pitch black aside from a low glow coming from what appeared to be stairs into the basement. Descending into the basement, they found a white translucent field appearing to shield a collection of items inside;\n+ 10 Items matching the description of the ${Curellian Artifacts}$ they were there to retrieve\n+ 1 ${Journal}$ with a note on top of it\n+ 1 ${Silver Power Crystal}$ on a pedestal in the middle\nIn front of the field seemed to be a sign post with a place to insert tiles, a bloody lab coat laying in front of it and some bloody tiles already in the board;\n```\n      I _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n_ _ _ _ T _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ L\n   _ _ _ N _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n```\n\nExamining the lab coat, a long streak of blood seemed to drag off down a hallway in the back of the vault area, and as it seemed they needed more tiles, they set about exploring the rest of the lab first. On noticing how clean the area was, ${Lucy}$ spat on the floor and noted it seemed to be self cleaning, possibly explaining the immaculate state of the building despite no one seeming to be around.\n\nHowever, the rest of the building yielded no additional tiles, leading the group back into the basement to work their way down the hallway. Turning off their light source to sneak as they followed the blood trail, they realized a slight red glow coming from an open door down the hall, noting that all the other doors appeared closed. ${Ginnet}$ sneaking ahead noted remains that may be the rest of the researcher's body, including his head...",

Setting out south through the ring of ${Charged Geist}$ currently surrounding the city, they struggled to escape after being caught in a terrible position. Pushing through they found that the Geists would eventually wander back toward the city, seemingly called to it and willing to ignore them after getting so far away.\n\nPushing on, they worked their way around the foothills and managed to avoid any other encounters. While resting, ${Torinn}$ and ${Xylaris}$ found themselves \"discussing\" with a group of angry spirits. But while negotiations seems to \"break down\", ${Torinn}$ offered the spirits ${Castupravus}$ which caused them to flee in fear. Noting the oddity, he left the hammer out in case anyone needed it while he caught up on his sleep, though they were undisturbed for the rest of their makeshift night.\n\nIn the morning ${Norwind}$ suspected he saw something north of them but could find nothing to confirm that he hadn't done more than blink too fast.\n\nCautious as they traveled, but making haste, they managed to reach the cave uneventfully. Once there, they were greeted by a ${Wraith}$, seemingly familiar in form as it held 2 ${Golden Blades}$. Using the ${Soul Speech Amulet}$ and ${Comprehend Languages}$, ${Torinn}$ was able to make out that the ${Wraith}$ was seeking a fee of some kind. Handing over a ${Coin of Styx}$ the ${Wraith}$ asks \"How many souls?\" to which ${Torinn}$ responds with ${6,,orange}$.

The cave only visible in a small area around them. However, the text seemed to be in ancient and moved far too quickly for any kind of studying, and no one came to greet or guide them. Though as they continued through the cave, ${Norwind}$ noted on their way in that the ${Wraith}$ didn't seem to move back to covering the cave entrance.\n\nEventually they stumbled on a room with a book on a pedestal and 5 symbols on the ground around it:\n+ A Bow\n+ A Dagger\n+ A Pair of Crossed Swords\n+ A Violin\n+ A Wand\n\nToying with them symbols, they noticed the blocks depressed once stepped on, and they all took a symbol:\n+ A Bow - ${Xylaris}$\n+ A Dagger - ${Norwind}$\n+ A Pair of Crossed Swords - ${Natty}$\n+ A Violin - ${Torinn}$\n+ A Wand - ${Orla}$\n\nTheir vision fading to black and they slowly found themselves on a boat, sailing across the open sea with a number of sailors manning the rigging as they approached 5 ships, seemingly in pursuit as 2 of the 5 slowed and seemed to move to engage them.\n\nA brief update from a sailor on their ship and they set off toward getting to one of the ships, moistening a tip of an arrow to fire ${Wandering Dust}$ onto one of the attacking vessels and teleport over to it.\n\nThere they engaged and killed the crew, ${Charming}$ and capturing the captain as he followed them back through the portal mere seconds before the disabled boat was out of range.\n\nTheir minds still their own as they watched the tale of these heros who now found themselves back on their boat, the tale of the adventurers continued...",

			"description": "Setting upon the spider inside the laboratory room, they found themselves challenged. Witnessing the creation of contained glowing red orbs that arced beams of fire toward creatures who attacked the spider and ${Ginnet}$ getting poisoned by the ${Red Crystalline Toxin}$, which was luckily cleared up by a ${General Poison Remedy}$. With the spider dead, they searched the lab and spoke with the dead head. Finding nothing in the laboratory room but getting some answers from the deceased:\n+ ${@Were you involved with the crystalline spiders?}$ ${I helped}$\n+ ${@Is the crystalline substance added?}$ ${Yes}$\n+ ${@What is the password?}$ ${I only know my positions}$\n+ ${@What was added to the crystalline spider?}$ ${It is a complex enchantment}$\n+ Mentioning that they were friends with Emerate Ringo and that she needs the deceased's help;  ${@How can the enchantments on the spiders be removed?}$ Laughing, the skull replied ${There is no removing the enchantments!}$ An Insight check seeming to reveal that this was likely the truth\n\nExploring the rest of the hallway, they found it to be quite long, lined with thick reinforced doors and a particularly large and well locked one at the end. Attempting to pick the lock, ${Ginnet}$ found himself thrust backwards by some kind of defensive mechanism in the lock as it proved to be quite difficult. Looking at the other locks, they all appeared to be the same.\n\nLooking around, ${Quincy}$ used ${Divination}$ and asked \"Which of these doors leads to clues we can find about the puzzle?\" to which he received the response \"You've found all the clues there are to find\".\n\nReturning to the puzzle board, they stared at it once more and realized that spaces may have been the missing clue and filled in the remainder in what appeared to be the solution;\n\n```\n      I _ A M _ T H E\nL I G H T _ T H A T _ A L L\n   T H I N G S _ H A V E\n```\n\nLeaving them the task of answering the riddle.\n\nPondering, they found themselves at a loss, however, in possession of several ${Wazos Steins}$. Taking a seat, ${Quincy}$ set about gaining the mystical dwarven wisdom lurking in the brew and had an insight that the people here seemed deeply vested in the crystals and drew the conclusion that the answer is likely a name of the crystal.\n\nThinking, the group recalled the names of many of the crystals, but found they didn't know the name of the ${Silver Power Crystal}$, guessing that it may be \"${Chromatic}$\" as the other names started with a \"C\", but found themselves washed over with ${Radiant}$ energy from the wrong answer, taking ${91 Radiant}$ damage from the ordeal. Digging through the notes, they sought out other information that may indicate the answer to the riddle.\n\nWhile searching, ${Lucy}$ stumbled across a better understanding of one of the notes that seemed to be a diagram of predator natures in species around the world and specifically noted a path for spreading the magical ${Aberration}$ nature of the spiders in the settlement.\n\nDeciding to take a long rest in the confides of the laboratory, they distanced themselves from the shield around the vault that had irradiated them earlier, taking the magical tiles with them just in case. As they slept, they found themselves questioned with a wordless inquiry; Their vision filled with the color red. Each responding \"${The Curator}$\" with the help of their own internal monologues of each other, and found themselves resting easily afterwards.\n\nNewly refreshed, they set back to answering the riddle. USing ${Absorb Elements}$ to help survive the ${Radiant}$ light, ${Ash}$ set about answering as everyone else hid inside a cast of ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$. And after brute forcing their way through all the names they knew, the answer was \"${The Composer}$\", the magical barrier releasing and letting them inside to retrieve the ${Curellian Artifacts}$, a ${Journal}$, and possibly the ${Silver Power Crystal}$. As they packed, ${Eldith}$ noticed a slight whisper coming from her bag and spending a few minutes digging through, they found that the ${Curellian Artifacts}$ seemed to be connected to the ${Hilt of the Blade of Mist}$, the hilt seemingly calling out to the other artifacts as it had once called out for its sister pieces, energy arcing between the pieces when close enough.\n\nInvestigating the area further, the power crystal appeared fastened to the pedestal on which it laid. A pedestal which seemed to have some kind of cross realm spell inscribed into it surrounding the power crystal and affixing it on top. However, after a few minutes of investigating they began to head heavy banging coming from upstairs, the first floor, where the doors they had unsealed were, the mechanical lock still appearing to hold.\n\nWith a new found rush, they set about collecting their new found goods, finding that the artifacts were immensely heavy. Discussing possible solutions, they settled on carrying the book and as many artifacts as they could on their persons and packing the rest onto a ${Floating Disk}$ as everyone else flies, hopefully out of reach and range of the spiders outside, keeping the disk close and using ${Sending}$ to let ${Statia}$ know they were running back and to get her, ${Emereta}$, and the children ready to leave.\n\nPreparing for their sprint, ${Quincy}$ placed ${Protection from Poison}$ on everyone, enchanted ${Lucy's}$ axe as a ${Holy Weapon}$ for light, and ${Erilore}$ and ${Eldith}$ gave everyone ${Fly}$. Pushing out into the darkness, ${Ginnet}$ used ${Minor Illusion}$ to distract the spiders as they went, the group managing to take to the air slip out toward the barn where the carriage was waiting.\n\nAs they hurried across the field, they noticed that the spiders seemed drawn to the ${Curellian Artifacts}$, piling on and over one another trying to take the artifacts off of the floating disk that was trailing them. Attempting to clear the spiders with a few spells or swings of their weapons, they managed to deteur many of them but lost 2 of the artifacts in the process, the spiders pilling into almost a ball around the artifacts as the heavy rods bounced from the disk in the fray. However, the large distraction seemed to greatly ease their escape, and ${Statia's}$ preparations had them on the road out of town without losing a beat.\n\nHeading East back towards the ${Caravan of Souls}$, they prepared for the journey back to ${Curell}$ with their rescued survivors in tow...",

			"description": "As their vision of the story continued, they continued on towards the remaining 3 ships, the ships they were on barely faster and managing to gain on the pirate vessels.\n\nUsing the time they had whilest regaining their lost ground dealing with the 2 ships that broke off from the pirate group, they interviewed their captured captain, learning that their \"Admiral\" is on the island where the boats are heading, there being no name to this island but a heading was noted by the ship's navigator.\n\nCatching up to their prey, they prepared for their assault, however were surprised by the pirate ships throwing things off into the water. The buoys were well dodged by the King's ships but slowed them down. The pirates seeming to use the buffer and the lowered weight to maybe gain and keep their distance, but it came to no avail.\n\nHoping to confuse the enemy, ${Erellia}$ enchanted an arrow with ${Darkness}$ and ${Serrenus}$ shot it to the middle of the starboard pirate ship's Quarterdeck, blinding the helmsman. Though to his credit, he kept the ship somewhat straight as much as the boat swayed from his \"corrections\".\n\nDiscussing their plan, the group portaled over with dust on the tip of ${Serrenus'}$ arrow once more, this time jumping to the ship farthest out from the starboard side of the ship, planning to take the ship and use it to ram the others. As they talked, their boat hit one of the buoyant chunks of debris that the pirate ships had been shedding. Peaking over the bow, ${Pombu}$ caught a glimpse of some form of Mercreature climbing up the ship walls. Fending it off, the group quickly set about getting aboard the other pirate ship. Taking the deck easily enough, they found themselves threatening a pirate who seemed ready to give up but with a swell of last minute abandon yelled \"For Galdur!\" before charging at ${Rotraru}$ and being struck down by the group.\n\nRunning up to the Quarterdeck, ${Rotraru}$ set about finding the helmsman, removing him, and steering the ship into the rest of the pirate fleet as the others set about dealing with the starboard side cannons on the middle pirate ship, another ${Darkness}$ enchanted arrow seemingly removing their ability to load, aim, or shoot. The remaining men on the main deck however set about preparing to board their freshly acquired twice stolen ship. As a deterrent, and then some, ${Erellia}$ threw a ${Fireball}$ at the preparing group, a cascading explosion ripping through its hull, the sounds of gun powder exploding filling the air as the two ships collided, ${Rotraru}$ having found the helmsman and steered the ship. The cries for help from the helmsman seeming to serve little good for the dead man.\n\nCaught in the explosion, ${Erellia}$, ${Citol}$, and ${Pombu}$ were thrown into the water amid the chaos of the ships exploding, sinking, and now threatening to keelhaul them. With some quick discussion, ${Erellia}$ pulled forth a door to her mansion and the trio quickly climbed in, letting the boats pass by and getting a quick lift from a well placed arrow and rope to get aboard the King's ship once again, just in time to watch the remaining pirate ships sink.\n\nTheir vision fading to black before returning to ${Reykurax}$, they took a minute to adjust but ${Xylaris}$ quickly noticed that the book they had been standing around was missing from its previous location and did not seem to be in the room. Suspecting that someone may have snuck in after them, they set about returning to the entrance, finding that the hallways had a magical darkness seemingly meant to keep people from running off too quickly and that traps had been left in the corridors, causing exceptionally debilitating migraines.\n\nSlowing their travel, ${Norwind}$ finds a trap ahead and notes that it seems rather simple, a tripwire attached to a rune covered cylinder. Examining it, ${Orla}$ notes that the runes seem to be related to portals of some kind, but the magic is rather advanced. However, in either case, simply cutting the tripline and leaving the cylinders alone effectively disabled the trap, allowing them to go forward, several other traps seemingly abound in the hallways.\n\nReaching the entrance, ${Torinn}$ used the ${Soul Speech Amulet}$ to talk with the guard once more and learned that a woman had entered with them as their 6<sup>th</sup> and had left before seeing them, though she had nothing of the Cave's when she left. Attempting to get a sense how long had passed, ${Torinn}$ found that the guard had little to no sense of the concept, but also found that he himself had no sense of how long had passed while they were seeing the events of ${Sorrow's Grace}$. Though while talking with the guard, he did learn that physical harm and fighting (and such) do not work within the cave and that as far as the guard knew, which was quite encomposing, all 5096 books were still present and accounted for within the Cave, though the guard is not responsible for the operations within the Cave. They also learned that the guard only accepts ${Coins of Styx}$ for entrance and that there are no other caves like this one in ${Reykurax}$. The last important bit being that if they step out, they will have to pay to gain entrance once again. \n\nHaving strained himself a bit while talking to the guard, and going through 2 charges from the amulet to learn what they did, the group set down to relax on the guarded side of the Cave's entrance and meditated on their ${Blessed Knowledge}$ while they pondered what to set out for next...",

			"description": "While heading east to join the Caravan, ${Ginnet}$ debated with the others on the merits of burying ${Opulance}$, and taking a moment to jingle it around, torn between trying to separate from it and the money inside, he judged the feel of the bag, his instincts telling him that there should at least be ${200,000}$ coin inside. Much to ${Lucy's}$ chagrin, the debate carried on for some time, ${Ash}$ and herself both noting that the coin purse is probably needed to break the connection. But eventually it was decided to bury the coin purse some ways off the path using ${Magic Mouth}$ to mark the path; Once from the road for where to start heading south, once along the way, and once at the tree where it is buried. For the purposes of protection, ${Eldith}$ set the spells to ony respond to the pressence of the 6 of them and to announce itself when they come within range:\n+ Ash\n+ Eldith\n+ Erilore\n+ Ginnet\n+ Lucy\n+ Quincy\n\nReturning to their path and taking a break to rest, they notice some eyes in the distance on the road. ${Eldith}$ dismissing her ${Dancing Lights}$ and ${Ginnet}$ bringing the carriage to a halt as they investigated ahead. Slowly working their way forward, they noticed the eyes belonged to several large cats, seemingly panthers.  As they approached, they barely noticed several panthers encircling them as those in front of them cautiously watched, a larger panther steping forward as ${Eldith}$ began to address them.\n\nTalking to the panthers, Panthers, ${Eldith}$ asks to pass, which the seeming king notes that he would be willing to let them pass for a trade, sniffing the air and requesting whatever they have that smells so delicious. Passing over the usual affair of food he sets about sniffing the others. ${Lucy}$ keenly noting that the other panthers around them are watchign very closely and growl at the slightest of movements. ${Erilore}$ using ${Subtle Spell}$ to use ${True strike}$ on the panther sniffing them learned his defenses:\n+ 238HP\n+ 16AC\n+ Acid Immunity\n+ Cold Immunity\n+ Lightning Immunity\n\nAs the panther sniffed them, he settled on ${Quincy}$ leading them to rummage through his bag, offering various food and crystals. And while the panther noted that the crystals smelled interesting, they were not what he sought. Noticably the ${Divine Blue Power Crystal}$ caused the panther to gag, seemingly revolted by the smell. After going through a few other items, ${Quincy}$ held a ${Curellian Artifact}$ out which seemed to be what the panther sought.\n\n${Eldith}$ tried to talk the panthers out of the artifact but had no luck, but did learn in passing that the panthers considered the creatures in the area to taste better of late. In the end, they gave the artifact to the panther and continued east, riding through the night and noticing that a number of panthers seemed to be at least near the road, cerulean eyes staring at them from the forest as they road for seemingly hours before they stopped seeming them in the darkness.\n\nOnce back at the ${Esclau Commune}$, ${Quincy}$ set about seeking the legend of the ${Curellian Artifacts}$ but found that nothing happened and on checking learned that the artifacts have no legend to seek.\n\nTaking a short break to rest up and prepare for the long trip, they packed up and joined the caravan heading back, ${Emereta}$ joining them for the trek with her children. As they traveled, the ${Anti-Magic Fields}$ of the Caravan seemed to stave off most attacks, but a group of wovles and possums set upon them in the middle of the day which struck them as an odd time, but they managed to drive both off without much effort.\n\nReturning to ${Curell}$, they dropped ${Emereta}$ and her children off at the gates and noticed that they had their own ${Mark of Curell}$ and entered the city without any issues and disappeared into a crowd as they discussed what they wanted to do, deciding on ${Statia}$, ${Erilore}$, and ${Ginnet}$ looking around outside the gates and hit a tavern as the others went inside to visit the castle and receive their bounty.\n\nReaching the castle, they waited a moment as some other matters were settled, watching a small group leave the chamber and then heading in to see only 1 Meister present in the chamber, a stout dwarven lady who identified herself as ${Antoku}$ and seemed somewhat blunt in her addressings. ${Lucy}$ noting a complaint regarding the danger involved requested more pay for the hassle and the failure to note how heavy the artifacts were, which ${Antoku}$ bluntly noted was why the pay was in fact so high in her regard. The others in her party seemingly okay with the sum to be paid, ${Lucy}$ begrudgingly smoked her pipe and eyed the dwarven woman. ${Antoku}$ unmoved by the display did seem to take some liking to ${Lucy's}$ persistance in some form or fashion.\n\nWith their rewards in hand, they about divying up their money, giving a small payment out to ${Statia}$ who graciously accepted the funds, and then set out to visit ${The Geishas}$ for their training. ${Statia}$ and ${Horus}$ spending time on ${The Geisha's}$ boat as the others trained.\n\n${Eldith}$ opting to read through the journal they retrieved instead of training and managed to finish it right as the others finished their training, everyone meeting back at the docks, before doing some shopping and discussing traveling to ${Lurus}$...",

			"description": "Discussing ${Lurus}$, the group went to catch ${Creara}$ in the Temple. Their arrival all the indication that ${Creara}$ needed and she noted she'd meet them in the morning as she'd like to enjoy the final moments of peace that she had. Respecting her request, the group set back off into town.\n\n${Ginnet}$ noted that it'd possibly be worth talking to the ${Meisters}$ about getting a mark for ${Erilore}$ and ${Statia}$. Joined by the rest of the group that could enter the city, they set off to ask.\n\nReaching the castle, they went inside and waited for the lone meister inside to finish her meeting with a small group of robed individuals. Entering after them, they spoke with ${Antoku}$ again, propsing the mark for their friends. After mentioning their names, the dwarven woman pulled out a large black tome and began to search through it. After some searching and asking for possible references of deeds done, she continued to read through the tome. Closing it, almost seemingly abruptly, ${Antoku}$ mentioned she had another matter to attend to and that the request to grant ${Erilore}$ and ${Statia}$ marks was denied. As she left, guards came in and escorted the group out.\n\nReturning to the Inn, they talked about why ${Antoku}$ left so abruptly, wondering if ${Erilore}$ or ${Statia}$ had something in their past or if the mention of ${Emereta Ringa}$ had something to with her refusal. Thoughts in mind, they got some rest before setting off in the morning.\n\nMeeting ${Creara}$ outside as expected, they grabbed some food. Looking around, they noticed that the dining area seemed particularly empty but after asking around, the chef and staff didn't really have any good explanations, noting only that the attacks from the wild life may be causing it, but that's essentially always been an issue on ${Colligus}$. Looking around a bit more, they finished eating and set off North with ${Creara}$ in tow.\n\nAfter a day or so of travel and a long rest, the group came across a trio in the road, one with an arrow in his shoulder, his skin abnormally pale considering how unthreatening the wound seemed it should be. Taking a look, ${Quincy}$ concluded that they should be able to meely remove the arrow but ${Ash}$ noted that the poor bloke seemed to be in a similarly shitty look as ${Quincy}$ did when had a stint as a pin cushion.\n\nDeciding to be cautious, ${Quincy}$ took out his ${Potion of Greater Restoration}$ and poured it into the man's mouth, and for a brief moment he seemed to feel better before his skin started to bubble, rolling into his whole body exploding in front of the group. His friends panicking, one passing out.\n\nTaking the opportunity to never leave a good body unused, ${Ash}$ set about making another ${Larry}$, the group soon found themselves beset by seeming bandits from the woods.\n\nMaking quick work of the seemingly would be robbers, they managed to subdue one and tied him up for questioning. Asking him about why they attacked the bandit noted they were hired but died as he continued to share more details. Looking around the group suspected a wizard or some such near by or that he was under effect of a spell like ${Gaes}$.\n\nSearching their bodies, ${Erilore}$ found that the arrows that the bandits were using were quite painful even if held at the shaft, taking a small amount of ${Necrotic}$ damage from seemingly mishandling them. But they managed to collect the items from them, 2 ${Hardened Oakan Composite Bows}$, 2 ${Quivers}$, and 21 ${Mysterious Black Arrows}$. ${Ginnet}$ opting to keep a bow and the arrows on him.\n\nContinuing the journey north, ${Eldith}$ left a ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$ for the remaining two friends to sleep in after surviving the trauma of their friend dying, being resurrected, and one of them being comforted by the cold skeleton hand of his friend's reconstructed skeleton. Keeping their eyes open, they reached the ship seemingly without incident after that. Packing everything into the boat, ${Cherub}$ unpacked the carriage into the ${Ntanti's}$ hold and the group set about paying the crew for the month.\n\nLooking at a map, they set to working out how to reach ${Lake Ricrire}$, to which ${Acrusial}$ noted that the ${Nautilin Navy}$ will likely not take kindly to their ship being in the Strait, particularly a ${Draconian}$ ship. Discussing some options for hiding the ship and retreating, they start north to sneak into the strait under the cover of night.\n\nMaking it to the strait, they manage to avoid much attention and keeping quiet and running dark at night, they managed to stay out of sight and slipped from a lone seeming patrol boat in the night, slipping into the rocky coast to hide before slipping back out to sea before a patrol along the shore spotted them.\n\nReaching a spot near the lake, they navigated along the coastal cliffs and slipped behind some tall rocks along the shore, giving the cover while the group climbed the some 3000 stub high cliff wall. ${Eldith}$ and ${Erilore}$ flying up with ${Creara}$ to check the coast with the last bit of night. Looking around they didn't see anythign alarming and setup the rope for everyone to start heading up. While the others were on the rope, the watch party managed to catch sight of an Orcish scout right next to them. Looking around, the scout seemed unaware of their pressence and continued to search along the cliff. ${Creara}$ motioning to hold still even after the scout passed, catching glimpses of a patrol party of some one to two dozen Orcs near by, followed by a few more scouts. After passing, the rest of the group finished climbing up and they sent the rope down to the boat so that it could retreat into an old near-by smugglers cove.\n\nThe sun creating over the sea as they prepared to set off for the lake...",

			"description": "Taking their time to continue to rest after viewing the story of ${Sorrow's Grace}$, they continued their meditations and their discussions for what to do about the mysterious woman and continued to ponder questions for the guard;\n+ ${@Can you read ancient?}$ Of course\n+ ${@Can you read this book to us?}$ I can read a part... [_Reads a part..._]\n+ ${@Can you read this part to us too?}$ [_Reading..._]\n\nListening to the guard read the passages, ${Orla}$ and ${Norwind}$ took notes of the different pronounciations and glyphs, attempting to discern the various differences in speach and writing, noticing that the symbols and the pronounciations seemed almost eradic but made a few connections to possibly help discern some pieces of the language.\n\nTaking the opportunity to rest before heading out they found themselves questioned in their sleep, the color green filling their dream vision. Sensing a request for an answer they all replied \"The Crafter\" except for ${Torinn}$ who replied with \"Are you the god of the forest?\".\n\n${Norwind}$ being the first to wake, took to surveying the area and caught a glimpse of a lenseflare in the distance. Wanting to investigate he made note but kept watch, waiting for ${Orla}$ to wake, where upon she sent ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ out to investigate. Though with everyone else awake, ${Torinn}$ continued to sleep, unresponsive to any stimulus but seemingly still alive.\n\nTrying various calm methods of waking him, they discussed possible causes. Pulling out ${Norwind's Ipse Doll}$ and after some inspection noticed that he seemed to be under some powerful sleep spell. Attempting ${Dispel Magic}$, ${Orla}$ found the spell fell short of being able to help their sleepy cleric. Pondering other solutions, they eventually found him awake on his own a few hours later, seemingly still himself and doing well.\n\nThough after using the ${Ipse Doll}$ on ${Torinn}$ they thought to pass the doll to ${Orla}$ and found several pecular enchantments on her, noticing a ${Divine}$, ${Enchantment}$, and ${Necromancy}$ magic on her, they discussed a bit and concluded that they're probably misunderstanding one of those magical schools and that they are likely related to ${Durong}$ in some way. Checking her over some more, they concluded that, at least for the moment, ${Orla}$ is likely fine. At least no worse than yesterday.\n\nReturning from her adventure, ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ noted that the location that ${Norwind}$ pointed out didn't seem to have anything.\n\nHeading back towards the ${Path of Ascension}$ they found a fairly uneventful journey after 2 days of travel, staying vigilent of anyone who may attack or at least be near by. As they went to setup camp, ${Xylaris}$ rolled her ${Night Die}$ and got back \"Danger\" for the night. After a short debate, they decided on using ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$ to sleep peacefully. Waking up, they looked around and seemed safe enough. ${Torinn}$ borrowing the ${Ipse Doll}$ to check ${Orla}$ once again and noting that at least nothing had seemed to change.\n\nNoticing a few rocks rolling down the side of the mountain irregularly, ${Norwind}$ and ${Xylaris}$ take a moment to scout ahead, using ${Xylaris}$ as bait to try to draw out whoever might be there. After awhile of waiting, they start to head back. Caught off guard, a Giant demon lands infront of ${Xylaris}$, roaring into the air right in front of her as she braced herself for battle.\n\n${Orla}$, ${Torinn}$, and ${Natty}$ rushing out to join her found themselves a few rounds out as ${Norwind}$ slowly manages to make out a humanoid near him, a flash of blue eyes shaking him momentarily, confirming his suspicion of an invisible creature near by.\n\nSteadying herself, ${Xylaris}$ fought the demon in front of her with ${Orla's}$ help thanks to her ${Dimension Door}$, they found themselves seemingly out matched as the demon clawed through their health and called for colored orbs of some unknown power that seemed to change colors. Occassionally retaliating with bolts of fire or seemingly protecting the demon in some way. Most notably when ${Orla}$ used ${Arcane Missiles}$ on a cyan colored orb and it seemed to heal the demon, and the yellow and red orbs were the source of the firebolts.\n\nAs they tangled with the demon, ${Norwind}$ tried to grab the would be invislbe creature near him, cleverly using his grappling hook to entangle and reveal it, managing to grapple her, her invisibility failing as she forced her way out from his grasp, revealing her to be the archer that attacked them back in ${Montis}$ when they were seeking information on the ${Great Wyrms}$ on Mikillabellera</span>. However just as soon as he saw her, she chugged a potion seemingly of invisibiliity and vanished from his sight. His attempt to capture her again failing.\n\nJoining the fight against the demon, ${Torinn}$ and ${Natty}$ found ${Xylaris}$ in quite a bit of pain and ${Orla}$ a bit more enlightened on what not to do but with the demon seemingly almost perfectly healthy. Taking in the situation, ${Natty}$ tapped into her ${Tiefling}$ prowess and cast ${Darkness}$ on one of her javelins, jamming it into the ground as the used the confusion to bolt from the demon.\n\nMaking some distance before they were noticed, the demon managed to quickly gain on them. ${Torinn}$ using a moment to throw up  a ${Sleet Storm}$ and other spells to stave off the demon, the group continued to run. Having lost sight of the demon in the spells and hurrying to run, they soon found themselves convinced that the demon was no longer chasing them and took a moment to rest and ponder what just happened...",

			"description": "Setting off towards ${Lake Ricrire}$ they found a few days of peace as they traveled up the sides of the mountains towards the lake, avoiding the patrols along the coastal cliffs and the rare patrol that found itself near the group. Reaching the top, they looked down to plan their adventure downward and saw 2 ${Orc War Camps}$, one north, and one south, each seeming to be in the area for training in the desolate area. Looking around, ${Creara}$ noted that the area appeared to belong to the orcish military now and that their concern on being seen would be a bit more harsh as they would likely be pulled back to a command tent for verification, though they may be able to talk their way out of it if a commander is present with the group that finds them, but that wouldn't be likely here.\n\nWhile surveying the area, ${Ginnet}$ made out what seemed to be several crates or chests laying around on the far side of the lake. Unable to make out many details about the prospective goods, he informed the group of the possible loot to be had as they made their plans.\n\nMoving during the night for cover and resting during the day under the cover of ${Lemuli's Tiny Hutt}$, they made their way down the mountain and managed some success but found the light of a patrol heading towards them at night. After a quick discussion of options, they opted to run for the lake, hoping to escape into the water using ${Quincy's}$ magic to control the water and allow them to submerge, using tiny hutt as a capsule for safety and air. Checking the patrol as they ran, they noticed that after a small delay the patrol seemed to turn and run back towards its camp.\n\nSpending 20ish minutes walking down the lake bed, they setup ${Lemuli's Tiny Hutt}$ and set about searching for the crates. The cover of darkness making it difficult to see and any light lit threatening to give away their position.\n\nUsing ${Locate Object}$ to get an initial bearing, ${Quincy}$ sensed a \"Crate\" nearby but was skeptical as he had little more to go on for use with the spell. However, ${Eldith}$ and ${Erilore}$ used ${Alter Self}$ to attain some water breathability and set off to see what it was that ${Quincy}$ was sensing.\n\nHeading out, they found what seemed to more accurately be the remains of a crate, and one that was seemingly smaller than what they expected and ${Ilerar}$ had described \"several\" crates and noted that they may be heavy. Grabbing a few pieces of the crate, they started back towards the hutt as they noticed the shadow and wake of something large swimming past them.\n\nSeeking some answers to questions about the crates, ${Eldith}$ reached out to ${Ilerar}$ via ${Sending}$ to ask about the crates, such as count but received no reply.\n\nAround the same time, while killing time, ${Ash}$ took a moment to attempt to do some fishing from the hutt with a spare stick and some rope. After a while of sitting about he found he improvised fishing pole yanked and held tight as he wa ssucked from the hutt, eventually deciding to let go before he might lose his bearings in the pitch black. The ladies helping to find him and get him back safely.\n\nPondering their predicament, ${Creara}$ noted that a shark should not be in these waters, though the caves beneath do likely head out to sea in some way, adding that the caves have not been explored to her knowledge. She went on to tell the group of her theory that the \"fish\" fit the description of the legend of the ${Smeryby}$ perfectly, whose name translated to Common was \"Death Fish\". Fitting of an Orcish legend, magic is said to not work on it and that even the bravest army would fall to its teeth. Though she also noted she had always assumed it a fairy tale told to young orcs to keep them inline, as many things in ${Lurus}$ exist for that purpose.\n\nDeciding that some recuperation was in order, they set about getting ready to rest. ${Pixie}$ changed to an Octopus to help keep an eye out for the large \"fish\". Meanwhile, ${Quincy}$ used ${Commune}$ to answer a few questions;\n+ ${@Is Ilerar Alive?}$\n ${Yes}$\n+ ${@Are the crates still in this lake?}$ ${Yes}$\n+ ${@Are the Orcs aware of our presence?}$ ${Yes}$\n\nAs morning came, they refreshed their hutt to stay dry and set about surveying their area once again with the light of day. Peeking out, they looked across the lake's floor and saw a few caves and caught sight of what seemed to be the crates. Though looking around, they weren't immediately able to see the ${Death Fish}$ and barely noticed that the lake seemed empty of any life, looking up and seeing nothing but clear water and sky.\n\nDiscussing ideas for dealing with the ${Death Fish}$ they noted the missing fish and the theft of ${Ash's}$ fishing pole and attempted using ${Create Food}$ and experimented with shoving the large amount of food out of the tent. Looking around, they managed to catch the shark like fish eating the food and used that time to head out.\n\nHeading for the crates, they managed to find them upon a pallet that after inspection with ${Detect Magic}$ was found to be magical and seemed to serve to protect the crates and make them easier to lift. Looking at the neatly packed pallet however, a non-trivially sized square stood out at a corner that seemed to indicate that at least one crate was missing from the pallet. Though likely only one.\n\nGrabbing the crates, they set off for the other side of the lake to avoid the Orcs and to check out ${Ginnet's}$ found loot, shoving more food out as they went for safety, but as night had set in they had to move slowly, eventually settling in for the night.\n\nWith the new day, they sent ${Pixie}$ out to check the shore as they prepared to continue, finding themselves a bit stir crazy from the small space and the fish outside.\n\nAs they headed toward the shore, ${Pixie}$ returned with tales of crates and skeletons partially buried beneath the shore's sand. As they reached the area themselves, they found what seemed to be the remains of a camp. ${Eldith's Detect Magic}$ spotting a few pieces of equipment and ${Quincy's Detect Good and Evil}$ finding the entire area to be Evil, as if poisoned somehow. ${Creara}$ noting that it seemed as though the lake had some kind of tidal surge that seemed to catch the camp. Inspecting the remains more closely, the group noted that many seemed to have missing limbs and bite marks that were unfamiliar to them.\n\nDeciding that staying near the shore may prove too eventful, they quickly discussed their next course of action and settled on running south to attempt to get out of the military area where their presence would be less suspicious and more easy to simply talk their way out of any potential conflict.\n\nWith the crates in tow, the empty space still unfilled, they set off southward under the cover of the forest...",

			"description": "The demon's disappearance still puzzleing them, they flanked around the side of one of the mountains to avoid the ${Wraiths}$ pouring out from around the ${Path of Ascension}$ while keeping their eyes out for there archer friend or her presumed pet demon. Searching the area, they found a decent place to rest but the ${Night Die}$ revealed that it would be dangerous to sleep where they were.\n\nAfter a quick discussion, they opted to use the distracted ${Wraiths}$ to their advantage, returning to the ${Path of Ascension}$ while going around the outcropping of ${Wraith}$, finding the area easier to move through with many of the ${Wraiths}$ gone. Quickly rushing to the boat where they previously found some of ${Sorrow's Grace's}$ gear, they found 4 more crates buried under debris that they managed to shift free. Looking over the chests and keeping an eye out, they struggled to investigate the chests and keep watch, a few ${Wraiths}$ slipping into the boat with them. While spotted by ${Norwind}$, they were already inside and out numbered him 3 to 1. Sending word ahead on a ${Sending Stone}$ to the others, they managed to hide in time, avoiding a confrontation.\n\nLooking the crates over, they tried a few ways of inspecting them, seeking out how to break the traps on them. As ${Orla}$ used an ${Ipse Doll}$ to try to see the effects crate, she found herself being overcome with pride, convinced she is the greatest of them all, her vision also fading to black as she caught herself in a trace and broke away from looking at the doll. Considering the crates cursed, they decided to rest so that ${Torinn}$ could prepare ${Remove Curse}$ and regain some spell slots.\n\nWaking up, they prepared to try removing the suspected curses, but as they set out to do so, they were surprised by several ${Wraiths}$ coming through the boat. The ensuing fight revealing that ${Wraiths}$ may in fact retreat, one seeming to set out to flee from the boat as his compatriots fell. However, the group managed to cut him off and slay him before he made any further progress.\n\nReturning to the chests, ${Natty}$ set about trying to open a chest with ${Remove Curse}$ now cast but found herself stone formed after trying to open it. Mixing somethign together to cure her friend, ${Xylaris}$ noted that she was getting low on ingredients and scavenging goods was getting expensive.\n\nInvestigating the chests further ${Orla}$ noted that, at least the chest she was looking at, was only able to ${Petrify}$ one creature per round at a time but that once the petrification wore off from the chest switching targets, the previous creature would need a round or 2 to recouperate. But also that the owner of the chests are the ones who can open it without issue, so there may be a way to trick the enchantment that identifies the owner into think they are the owner, but assuming these do belong to ${Sorrow's Grace}$, its difficult to determine who is expected for each chest as none are labeled in anyway.\n\nPondering possible ways to navigate opening the chest, they decided to come back to it, venturing out to another near-by boat. As they looked around to plan their trip they noticed that the waterfall for the path was devoid of ${Wraiths}$ underneath the falls. Taking a moment to inspect the water, ${Xylaris}$ noted that while she could get the water into a flask, it would eventually disappear from the flask. ${Orla}$ noted that there seemed to be some kind of ${Divine}$ effect on her hand while holding it under the water. And ${Torinn}$ noted that if he tried to hold material under the water, he could feel the force of the water falling onto the plank of wood, and noted that the feeling that they felt on themselves was comparitively very subtle and almost calming. Experimenting, ${Orla}$ ventured into the falls with a rope tied to her and tried jumping around or swimming and found herself fairly well grounded.\n\nReturning to the task at hand, they set about getting to the other boat. Looking around, the insides of the ship were in disarray but investigation did reveal several traps about that had been exposed by the damage but were still operational that seemed to be constructed to ${Banish}$ any creature that may trigger it. Carefully destroying the trap would likely release any banished creature but they could likely also be destroyed in a way as to leave the banished creature trapped or at least somewhat removed.\n\nCarefully exploring the area, ${Norwind}$ found 3 plain looking ${Leather Armors}$ hanging on an ornate wall in the remains of a room that had quite a few traps. Sneaking over, he managed to procure the armors before sneaking back out from the room.\n\nConversing with one another and exploring they deemed the ship looted and returned to pondering what to do next, ${Torinn}$ contemplating a tent beneath the waterfall to protect them from the ${Wratihs}$...",

			"description": "Starting off towards the trees, they set back toward the beach briefly to consider the skeletons there one more time. Seeking out a skull, ${Eldith}$ felt an erie magic against it as she went to grab it, backing away from it she decided to use ${Mage Hand}$ to grab the skull and noticed that the magical hand was darkened where it had touched the skull. Deciding to leave it, she left the skull on the ground and went to investigating ${Ash's}$ new constructs but all tests seemed to conclude that they were fine.\n\nSurveying the lake and keeping a weathered eye, ${Lucy}$ noticed that the only sand along the beach was where ${Quincy}$ had sensed the ground as ${Evil}$ and it seemed to span several hundred studs up and down the lake where they were, amounting to a small portion of the lake's coast.\n\nPacking up, they start off into the tree line once again, and after awhile of travel note that they are noticeably having difficulty covering their trail. Deciding to \"Bunny Hop\" with ${Fly}$, ${Ceara}$ noted it should serve to break up their trail and use the tree tops to obscure their path. Agreeing, they all prepared to cast or receive ${Fly}$ and packed ${Ash's}$ Larry's onto the ${Magical Pallet}$, finding that the enchantment made them all trivial to lift, but did nothing to secure them in place as the containers were.\n\nWith the skeletons secured and 3 people carrying the pallet as the others scouted ahead, they managed to push through the trees and northwest, hoping to throw off anyone tracking them by doubling back as well. On landing, they checked the area, covered the crates and skeletons, and slept under a ${Tiny Hut}$.\n\nWaking up with some time to spare, ${Eldith}$ sent ${Pixie}$ out to scout and cast ${Sending}$ to ${Ilerar}$ once more. While ${Ilerar}$ once again did not respond, ${Pixie}$ noted a tent very near-by of 2 to 3 people judging by the size but only saw 1 herself. As everyone else woke, she informed them of the tent and they all set off quietly south, avoiding the tent.\n\nMaking their way south and over, they had a relatively clear journey until they reached a pass in the ${Brurniril Mountains}$ to the coast line where they managed to catch sight of 2 ${Orcs}$ seemingly on some kind of guard duty, which ${Creara}$ noted they seemed more of the criminal type than the military type but added that the shield they had seemed particularly special compared to the rest of their gear that was seemingly just standard issue military gear.\n\nDiscussing their options, ${Creara}$ explained that the territory they were in was ${Crag Hound}$ territory and that the pass they were on was the only \"safe\" way through the territory without the possibility of running into a pack. After describing the deadliness of the hounds, the group agreed that the pass was the best option and after some pondering ${Lucy}$ suggested to mimic a funeral procession. Thinking it over, ${Creara}$ noted it would be possible but that they would certainly be tested and need to be prepared to stand their ground to an unflinching degree.\n\nAfter a few hours of training and practicing in the woods, the group used several illusions and other enchantments to prepare and disguise themselves, ${Creara}$ acting as the Shaman to the procession, running ahead to talk to the 2 ${Orcs}$ at the pass as the group approached. Attempting to hear what was happening, ${Eldith}$ used ${Comprehend Languages}$ as the group watched ${Creara}$ have a quick exchange of blows with one of the ${Orcs}$ before they both sheathed their weapons and ${Creara}$ carried onward, their signal that they passed the first obstacle.\n\nAs the group marched past, they were indeed challenged, growled at and menacingly charged at only for them to stop fractions of a stud short. Everyone managing to maintain a stern, unflinching gaze forward as they carried out their march. As they passed, they heard several howls in the distance on both sides of them, obviously ${Crag Hounds}$ but unsure if a natural or trained timing. Rounding the final bend out of sight they checked their rear and found themselves unfollowed and the 2 ${Orcs}$ still in their post, and they carried on toward the coast.\n\nReaching the bay ${Eldith}$ reached out to ${Acrusial}$ via ${Sending}$ and was told the boat is running about half a day late due to an ${Orc Fleet}$ in the strait and that they found a stow away that was raving as though he'd lost his mind. Looking around, they opted to deal with their immediate issue of finding cover while they waited, ${Pixie}$ noting a cave below them. Flying down into the cave as they had \"Bunny Hopped\" before, they found a large cove that seemed to offer a good amount of protection but noticed a few guards along the ridge from the lamps above them, noting that the glistening cove would surely reflect any light out and announce that someone was inside.\n\nExploring deeper into the depths of the cover, ${Ginnet}$ noted a distinct clicking sound that reminded him of the ${Crystal Spiders}$ walking against the stone slabs in ${Gravesend}$...",

			"description": "Pulling stuff from the ship into the waterfall, ${Natty}$ found herself carrying a mimic at the edge of the waterfall, the party finding themselves once again fighting a mimic, seemingly the same as the one from before. Fighting it, ${Xylaris}$ managed to study it and learned that while it was a mimic, there was something special about the mimic. While seemingly heartier, it was specially its acidicly necrotic cloud that stood out.\n\nAfter battling with the mimic, they set about constructing a small hut under the waterfall, using a ${Mutus Candle}$ to avoid any noise attracting the attention of nearby ${Wraiths}$ and securing several solid pieces of wood for construction underneath the falls.\n\nAs they slept in the comfort of the falls they found themselves seemingly in a dream, the falls gone and seemingly nothing but the top of the mountain in their view. They found themselves approached by 3 seeming ${Ancients}$, their serpentine form similar to ${Alisco's}$. They were brief in their speech and skipped introductions, coming and leaving with as much mystery, but seemingly brought ${Sorrow's Grace}$ to them where the group seemingly collected the crates and ${Serrenus}$ collected her weapons from ${Norwind}$, though she let the elf keep the armor and other items he had acquired seemingly from the same crate.\n\nManaging to speak with the ranger for awhile, they learned that there was seemingly a life after this for some and that a bond can be formed with some weapons or maybe even just equipment that allow it to follow them into another realm, similar to ${Alisco's}$ note regarding how he'll still have use for his items once his tomb fades to the aethereal sea. They also learned that ${Erellia}$ had somehow become a God, but ${Serrenus}$ simply shrugged beyond that noting that she didn't understand any of it but knew that ${Rotraru}$ had opted against it so it couldn't be all fun and games.\n\nLeaving them to finish resting, ${Pombu}$ returned briefly, holding his crate open and noted that ${Andizyo}$ was missing and sought answers. But as ${Norwind}$ had freely parted with ${Serenity}$, ${Serrenus}$ noted that they likely didn't have it. The rogue begrudgingly closing his case and seemingly drifting back out into the void. ${Serrenus}$ bidding them adieu and departing herself. Waking under the waterfall, the group found the crates were indeed missing and that the waterfall was indeed still present.\n\nExploring the other boats further, they found a few more goods to bring with them, ${Xylaris}$ falling into a pool of chaotically mixed potions and finding herself with a seeming ${Curse of Frost}$, the liquid itself seeming to be cursed as the potion vial froze over trying to contain even a small portion of the mixture. ${Torinn}$ saving her with a cast of ${Remove Curse}$. However with the large groups of ${Wraiths}$ moving about, they found themselves departing, flying up and into the waterfall.\n\nAscending the waterfall, they watched as the blue water trickled past and slowly changed to walls, their feet coming to rest on solid seamlessly as they found themselves in a stark blue room with a lone Ancient at a desk. As they spoke with the Ancient, he inquired and dug, asking why they should be allowed to leave and they slowly learned what ${Alisco}$ meant when he noted that the clerics who act as the gatekeepers were assholes.\n\n\"Negotiating\" with the Ancient cleric, they learned little except that the cleric seemed to wish to send them back, noting several times that he seemed to find them \"wanting\" in terms of merit. However, the piece they managed to learn was that ${Waitiri}$ seemed to have some sway, her seemingly being the sole reason that the group had made it this far as they stood before the judgemental book keeper.\n\nFishing for rhyme or reason to let them through the cleric settled on a final question:  \n${@What is always ahead of you but can not be reached or seen?}$\n\nThey huddled and debated, settling on 3 possible answers from what they knew of the Ancients and their predicament. Knowing that the ${Ancients}$ were seers and knew the future, \"${@Future}$\" seemed a notable choice and along those lines, so did \"${@Tomorrow}$\". However, as they sat being judged and were found \"wanting\", \"${@Potential}$\" seemed to also work, though the hope was that they would eventually reach their potential, the cleric before them might not believe it to be possible.\n\nBelieving to have settled on an answer they broke their huddle and as they looked away, the scenery around them came flooding into view, the familiar mossy rocks, the large room, the eclipsed radiant glow of the sun. As they took in their new view they quickly recognized where they stood; In the very place where ${Whaitiri}$ had \"blessed\" them with knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, as they looked around, they quickly noted the seeming dozen or two of ${Kintari}$ that seemed to occupy the area, one lone warrior doing a double take as they both noticed one another and a quick ${Illusion}$ from ${Orla}$ quickly obscured them, the seemingly out of it warrior shaking his head and returning to lazily watching what is apparently a boring post, leaving the party to ponder what to do now...",

			"description": "Deep inside the cave, ${Ginnet}$ spotted an rune of <span class=\"rs-lightblue ra ra-capricorn\"></span> along the side of a small branch in the cave. Exploring into the cave they found it dark and seemingly resistant to ${Divination}$ magic, their attempts to use it seeming thwarted by bright white light, blinding their ability to see or gain any information. Even ${Lucy}$'s ${Aura Lense}$ seemed to merely turn into a torch as the bright white hue shone through the viewing side of the enchanted spyglass.\n\nGiving up on identifying the rune or searching for magical clues, they took to more traditional investigation. ${Eldith}$ managing the ascertain that the rune was caved into the rock face long ago, likely with fairly primitive tools. And exploring around with her spyglass a lite, ${Lucy}$ managed to find a seeming \"entrance\" where the bright light from divination seemed to cease. Casting ${Dispel Magic}$, the group managed to see a seeming barrier shimmer but no effect seemed to happen beyond that.\n\nSneaking deeper into the cave, they stumbled upon a large crab like creature with tendrils along its back. Its exoskeleton the source of the unnerving crystalline like clacking against the rock. While seemingly otherworldly, the group managed to slay the crab, it's body turning to some form of stone and crumbling into a pile of rubble. Shifting through the rock, they found an ${Old Scroll}$ with a strange glowing dot. Using his map reading skills, ${Ginnet}$ was able to determine that the dot seemed to be a marker for somewhere deeper in the branch of the cave.\n\nSlightly past the newly formed rubble, they found a white barrier, seemingly similar to that in the vault of ${Gravesend}$ but not translucent like the one there. Recalling their time in the castle at ${Hwand}$ and the various color puzzles they had recovered, ${Eldith}$ and ${Ginnet}$ snuck through the veil to see what was on the other side.\n\nPast the glowing barrier they found 2 more crab creatures lurking about, seeming eating the other half of the legs they had found on the other side of the barrier. What stood out however was a pristine white pedestal with slots for 6 humanoid creatures to release something, similar to complex chests that ${Ginnet}$ had seen in his time at the mines. Sneaking back out, the managed to remain unnoticed and the group discussed how to deal with the creatures, eventually settling on luring them out and managing to kill them in the cave, learning that the tendrils at least appear to be capable of summoning odd colored orbs after a few moments of energy surging through them.\n\nWith the crabs removed, they worked their way through the barrier and briefly investigated the area, finding a small crate with sheets of paper inside near the pillar with the <span class=\"rs-lightblue ra ra-capricorn\"></span> rune. Surrounding the pillar, they all reached in and activated the switches ${Ginnet}$ had noted, and with the activation, found themselves stuck to the pillar as the room filled with water, their minds filling with unknown information, seemingly both past and future as they struggled to break free before losing consciousness.\n\nAfter some unknown time, they found themselves awake on the ${Ntanti}$, ${Acrusial}$ and ${Creara}$ looking down on them as them spewed up water and groaned back to life. ${Creara}$ had managed to grab their stuff and the crates and keep everything together until the ${Ntanti}$ arrived, the crew helping bring everything aboard. Coming around, the crew brought them up to speed on the crazy man and the unseen panther down below decks.\n\nHeading down, ${Cherub}$ walked them down, their ears quickly filling with the wailings of some crazed madman. At the bottom of the stairs, a hole had been recently torn open and dropped into the space between the hull and the deck. they all dropped down into the darkness and managed to make out that the wailing man that they could see in the back of the boat was in fact the Ranger they had run into sometime ago, having left a note with him after being attacked by what appeared to be his panthers with power crystals embedded in their chests.\n\nApproaching him, they collectively heard a growl but saw no cat to make such a noise. ${Ginnet}$ headed to the main deck to ask the crew if they had seen or noted anything while ${Eldith}$ schemed to get to the man in the back. While ${Ginnet}$ found nothing of note, as the crew had mostly avoided the seemingly dangerous yet benign situation, the group shuffled forward and managed to unknowingly goad the panther into showing itself as it postured to keep them out. Looking around, ${Erilore}$ tried ${True Strike}$ on the beast and got no information back, a puzzling situation. ${Ash}$ throwing a ${Firebolt}$ at the creature and noting that the fire seemed to have no effect on its hide. Curious and determined, ${Eldith}$ teleported back to the man in the back and quickly found herself disoriented.\n\nNow standing behind the wailing ranger, ${Eldith}$ looked around and was unable to see her compatriots, the darkness seemingly longer than her ${Dark Vision}$ reached and the man's wailings did nothing to help her concentration. As she looked however, she saw the ${Panther}$ turn towards her, preparing to strike as the others looked onward in confusion and slightly preparing to aid her. However, her adventure was short lived as the panther's teeth sunk into her shoulder before hurling her back towards her party, ${Lucy}$ catching the dwarf as she flew back.\n\nWith ${Eldith}$ back with the group, the panther again postured at the entrance. ${Erilore}$ tried using ${Whisper}$ and found herself with an earful of ravings, quickly dismissing the incantation and the group shuffled back upstairs. Pondering, they theorized that the man is in some sort of ${Pocket Dimension}$ and ${Eldith}$ transformed into a cat before heading back down to negotiate with the Panther.\n\nTalking with the large cat, ${Eldith}$ was greeted as \"Dwarf\" as the panther addressed her and after many questions and attempts at persuasion, the panther's answer remained the same; \"${@Leave Galvin Be}$\". Giving up on this round of negotiations, she left fish outside the seeming entrance to the suspected portal and left the 2 be as the group pondered what to do next...",

			"description": "Pondering on the mysterious portal in the bottom of their ship and the strange man and beast inside it that they had come to know as a tall grumpy elf ${Galvin Broadshore}$ and a loyal black panther ${Crado}$. Over a few days attempting to talk with the panther and being growled at as they worked out how to help the ailed elf so that they could find some peace on their boat. Luckily having a crystal on hand to use with ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$ for some crucial rest on the boat, thouogh finding themselves somewhat perturbed from ${Lucy's}$ writer's block one night.\n\nAs the nights went by, ${Eldith}$ used ${Ikatibha}$ to talk with the hostile panther, trying to work out a way in which she could pass it to reach the elf in the back. After some failed attempts, she passed the staff along to ${Erilore}$, who quite capable of charming, gave her attempt at speaking to the beast and managed to learn that the panther simply didn't trust them and seemed to be following the would be wishes of his master by keeping them out. However, she did manage to catch thei rnames; Galvin and Crado. But did note that using ${Suggestion}$ seemed to have no effect, adding to the list of things to which the panther seemed immune.\n\nLooking around with ${Detect Magic}$ they found the magical barrier where ${Conjuration}$ magic started the portal. ${Quincy}$ using ${Detect Good and Evil}$ detected nothing by the portal. Pondering, ${Eldith}$ used ${Sending}$ to contact ${Stibusix}$ to ask about ${Galvin}$ and ${Crado}$, the old cooky elf replying with a laugh and \"Galvin is still alive! that old fool. Take time, Crado is an angry furball\".\n\nWith ${Stibusix}$ notes, they mentioned the old elf as he seemed to know ${Galvin}$ but this simply seemed to anger the panther, an old grudge seeming present, leading ${Lucy}$ to try to recall the elf's voice and prepare what she believed to be a convincing representation to try to throw off the angry furball below their ship's hold.\n\nDetermined, ${Eldith}$ slipped into the portal and ${Misty Stepped}$ to the back and once at ${Galvin}$, created a ${Tiny Hut}$ and set about inspecting the elf as ${Crado}$ let out a loud roar, threatening to fear everyone but leaving everyone mostly on edge except ${Lucy}$ who found herself a bit concerned.\n\nWhile in the hut, ${Eldith}$ reached back out to ${Stibusix}$ and learned that ${Galvin}$ supposedly learned Ancient at some point and supposedly went mad from it. Trying to help him, she tried ${Blight}$ to try to shock him out of whatever trance he was in and found herself suffering from her own spell. Taking a moment to rethink, she tried to search his things and found that he had a special bag of holding and a desperate attempt to use a ${Scroll of Touch}$ seemed to have no effect. Using ${Detect Magic}$ to look the elf over, she noticed his equipment to be fairly special, but he himself seemed oddly enchanted in some way and a pouch on his belt gave off a sheer white light that seemed to defy the conventions of magic that she knew.\n\nUsing message, ${Eldith}$ and ${Erilore}$ managed to stay in touch as ${Crado}$ pawed at the hut and growled menacingly at it, trying to get back to ${Galvin}$, eventually sitting and growling intermittently as he starred angrily at the barrier.\n\nAfter some discussion, ${Eldith}$ held a power crystal to ${Galvin}$ and noticed his eyes seem to unfix and dart around before seeming to sink back into some void. Having but 1 crystal on her, the group worked out a plan and ${Quincy}$ used a scroll of ${Anti-Life Shell}$ and found himself reaching deeply into his connection with ${Dionysus}$ as he invoked the barrier and began walking towards the hutt to take a Blue and Green power crystal to ${Eldith}$.\n\nAs ${Quincy}$ went down the portal, ${Crado}$ lunged at him, his large paws seeming to dent the barrier around him but the barrier managed to repel the fuzzy creature, keeping ${Quincy}$ safe as he delivered the crystals and allowed ${Eldith}$ to snap ${Galvin}$ out of his torment where she learned that he needed to be taken out of the portal as the elf struggled to communicate.\n\nOnce removed, ${Galvin}$ quickly told ${Crado}$ that he could relax and seemed to nurse a heavy headache, noting that the woman who they referred to as \"The Red Pirate\", ${Inrena Sollace}$, had done something, quite likely damaging the fabric of the realm, that had caused his headache in the first place, though he knew not what.\n\nOffering aid, food, shelter, and rest, the group and the crew did what they could to help the grumpy elf, ${Lucy}$ noting her dislike for the old man but surprisingly ${Acrusial}$ was an old friend, noting that a ship he served on used to ferry ${Galvin}$ and his small troop of adventurers around. The subsequent days involved a few stories here and there where they learned of ${The Royal Rum}$ where ${Acrusial}$ served as first mate under a hearty swarf named ${Naveas Stealcore}$, that would ferry goods and people with the usual unscrupulous nature of \"No Questions Asked\". That being where ${Acrusial}$ met ${Galvin}$ and his friends; A Tiefling Bard ${Minestra}$ and a Gnomish Forest Cleric ${Orvin}$. Both of whom helped ${Galvin}$ raise ${Crado}$ back when he was just a cub after they defeated a band of Orcs who had recently raided a small village and killed some of the local wildlife when the village proved unsatisfactory.\n\nThroughout the trip, ${Galvin}$ was resistance to their aid and noted himself capable of helping himself when challenged for more information than he seemed willing to give. Though one night the group asked about his knowledge of Ancient to which he noted that he had no control over the knowledge, simply entering some trance and spewing non-sense, though his tale had been embellished by many bards and sung across the lands. ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ pondering an anti-propaganda routine for their travels, which ${Galvin}$ pointed out is far less interesting than \"Crazy man in the woods\".\n\nReaching a bay near ${Curell}$, the group prepared to set off into town with ${Ilerar's Crates}$. Checking with ${Galvin}$, noting that he still seemed to have a headache as they prepared to lower their rowboats, the Ranger simply gave his thanks and jumped overboard, leaving the group and their crew to watch in awe as he and ${Crado}$ walked across the calm waters of the bay and disappeared into the tree lines as they finished getting ready.\n\nWith the carriage to help tow them in, they made good time and avoided the guards from the previous trip and a new route also hopefully helping to deter any who maybe hunting for them. Reaching ${Curell}$ without incident, ${Quincy}$ had some time to look into some of their items and found that the ${Oddly Bound Book}$ was simply an oddly bound book and had no special name or history that he was able to discern from ${Identify}$.\n\nEntering the town with ${Ash's Larrys}$ in tow, the guards almost unphased by the Larrys these days as they set about going to speak with the ${Meisters}$ and arranging a meeting with ${Ilerar}$ for the <span class=\"rs-lightblue\">10<sup>th</sup> of Alucevum</span>...",

			"description": "Back in ${Curell}$ the group set about exploring, shopping, and talking to the ${Meisters}$ once more for more information, and learning that ${Ilerar}$ will be in town in a few days and they will reach out to the ${Temple of Dionysus}$ when he's ready to receive his crates. Heading to ${Holer's Civvies}$, ${Lucy}$ and ${Ash}$ learned that ${Ilerar}$ is looking for new artwork having discovered that one of his hideouts had been looted.\n\nThe ${Meisters}$ were somewhat busy but ${Univy}$, ${Avora}$, and ${Antoku}$ were able to have an audience with some of the group. Discussing the new happenings in the area they learned that hundreds of people had gone missing and even more were disappearing both inside and outside the walls.\n\nInquiring as to where people had gone missing, they learned that ${The Hoffle}$, a prestigious tavern inside the walls of ${Curell}$ was home to several recent disappearances and had the unique fortune of being fairly well monitored to assist in determining where people were when they went missing; In this case, rooms 206, 509, and 710. Pondering other avenues, they recalled the room in the back of the ${Cornoset}$ cave and the ${Antoku}$ noted that the room was guarded and had gone unused, nor had anyone from ${Curell}$ investigated it beyond looking at it.\n\nIn further causes of the disappearances, ${Avora}$ mentioned the heightened activity of bandits in the area, noting some ${17,,orange}$ known problematic characters in the area and the group was given specially marked warrants for each bandit in question.\n+ 10 Bandits worth ${100,,orange}$G each, known for violent crimes but all considered to lack the coordination of anything substantial.\n+ 4 Bandits worth ${300,,orange}$G each, somewhat coordinated and possibly having help, but these are more seen as contract assassins and such; Skilled but mostly bought rather than independently motivated.\n+ 3 Bandits worth ${500,,orange}$G each who all seem to be the coordinated type with teams of people and driven. However, while threatening in their organization, not considered threatening in their abilities. \n\nTaking a brief repose, ${Quincy}$ took a moment in the ${Temple of Dionysus}$ to medidtate on ${Ruamoka}$. While contemplating the goddess, he learned that she is a neutral force and the driver of magics in the realms and she is on good terms not just with ${Dionysus}$ but with all the gods across the spectrum.\n\nHoping to get ${Erilore}$ and ${Statia}$ in to join them, they asked about getting the two marked, which seemed to perk up ${Univy}$ and left ${Avora}$ visibly riled, though seemingly more because ${Univy}$ had stirred awake than anything else.\n\nThe ${Meister's}$ pale white eyes stared them down. Clearly able to see, he approached them and peered into ${Ash's}$ memories, focusing on the events of ${Gravesend}$ and noted that ${Erilore}$ and ${Statia}$ are to report to the ${Meister's}$ castle if they wish to be considered for marks. Returning to the tavern with a platoon of curellian soldiers around them, they convinced ${Erilore}$ to return to the castle, however ${Statia}$ declined, noting as before that she had no interest in being marked and tracked by the ${Meister's}$ and whoever their masters might be. Back at the castle, ${Univy}$ granted ${Erilore}$ a 7 day pass to aid the group in the investigation, her access expiring at the start of ${@Alucevum 13, 319}$.\n\nInside the walls, they contemplated their next move, deciding that talking to ${Emereta}$ may prove the most productive but on casting ${Sending}$ to reach out to her, she thanked them and declined their request to visit, stating that she was terribly busy but appreciated the offer.\n\nCurious, ${Quincy}$ cast ${Commune}$ and inquired about the situation:\n+ Is Emereta hiding something from us? Yes\n+ Did Emereta and Statia know each other before Gravesend? No\n+ Has Statia been truthful with us? Yes\n\nIntrigued, ${Eldith}$ went to cast ${Scry}$ on ${Emereta's}$ son ${Tumbe Ringa}$ but the cast failed, though seemingly not because he saved against it. Tabling the pursuit of ${Emereta}$ for the time being, they headed to ${The Hoffle}$ to investigate the disappearances.\n\nTalking to the receptionist, he explained the room's magical locks, wait staff on attendance at all times of day and night, and noted the rooms where guests had disappeared; 206, 509, and 710. And while some had been in the Inn alone, ${Mr. Dinoir}$ had been staying with his wife and had seemingly disappeared mid-shower while his wife was away. Wanting to look into the items, the receptionist noted that the contents of all the rooms had been turned over to the city guard and that those 3 rooms were under guard themselves. Leaving their contact information as the ${Temple of Dionysus}$ they set out to investigate the room contents as their warrants for the bandits and investigating the disappearances should grant them moderate access.\n\nFinding a near-by guard, they got directions to the ${Warden Garrison}$ and sought it out, showing their warrants to get access to the contents of ${Mr. Vishin Dinoir's}$ room. Heading into the 6<sup>th</sup> basement of the Garrison to see the possessions of the people they identified as ones that had been taken away.\n\nExploring the vault, ${Quincy}$ took a look around with ${Detect Poison and Disease}$ and ${Detect Good and Evil}$ not finding any poison of disease but a decent scattering of both Good and Evil in the possessions laying around. Checking the towel before using it to ${Scry}$, ${Quincy}$ gave the all clear and ${Eldith}$ set about trying to find ${Mr. Dinoir}$ but found the spell unsuccessful, despite the towel. Inquiring a bit further and exploring a bit more, they wrapped up in the vault and headed back to the temple to speak with ${N'orel}$, letting him know that someone may come looking for them, and to regroup and ponder their next move...",

Searching for the blade, the ${Compass of Ambition}$ pointed back towards whence they came, seemingly saying that the blade was back in the temple.\n\nTaking a moment, ${Torinn}$ used ${Sending}$ to contact ${Po}$ and inform him of their situation and request help, getting a response that he would try to help, though slightly annoyed at his interrupted retirement and now having to locate a boat.\n\nSneaking their way back through the forest, they managed to avoid several patrols but found themselves caught along their journey, dipping into a tree line to lose them along a hill where the 2 ${Savants}$ on their tail slipped, slowing the patrols enough for them to escape, but not before the strangely dressed Kintarian creatures let loose a Fireball each at extreme range, engulfing the party in flames as they slipped away.\n\nHaving managed to disappear into the forest once again, they took to running towards the temple but managed to spot an opening guarded by 3 seemingly juvenile ${Kintarian Warriors}$. Sneaking over to the opening, the 3 guards were quite distracted talking to one another. Investigating the covering over the opening, they noticed that part of it seemed partially constructed from dead humanoid creatures and it seemed mostly artificially constructed as if bored out by a young ${Great Wyrm}$.\n\nDistracted with their chatting, the guards were easy pray with the use of a ${Mutus Candle}$, giving the group the element needed to kill the 3 without a warning going out to the others. Gathering at the entrance, ${Po}$ reached out to let them know that he had found a boat and should be there in 2 weeks, arriving sometime around ${@Skaparvum 17, 319}$ and that he'd contact them again when he was near to see if they were still among the living.\n\nWith the hope of rescue coming and a blade to retrieve, they set off into the dark tunnel...",

			"description": "Exploring the entrance they had found they discovered a large cavernous abode that seemed to stretch quite far. The first chamber of the cave they encountered was vast and quickly seemed to transition to twilight, small flickers of light seeming to indicate a scattering or torches deeper in the cave. Finding nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity, they hide the bodies among the stalagmites in the chamber and set about investigating the next chamber.\n\nChecking to the south, ${Norwind}$ used his ${Cape of Invisibility}$ to shroud himself and left the ${Mutus Candle}$ with the group as he snuck around the southern chamber. There he found two groups of various ${Kintari}$ to the west, noting that they seemed busy around tables, and also a pool surrounded by what seemed to be prisoners or slaves and guards. The pools were filled with a glowing mixture and seemed to be composed of liquified power crystals similar to those they found in the ${Idoru Academy}$. Taking a moment to watch, the priosoners stiring the pot seemed to slowly be dying and a large creature was slowly climbing out of the pot as though it were still slowly forming. Looking closely at the creature, it seemed to be a ${Kintari Savant}$. Satisfied with his oservation of the pool, he set off south and found dozens of ${Kintari}$ seemingly asleep but managed to spot what appeared to be 2 ${Spell Books}$ on a table near what seemed to be a group of the sorcerer-esq kintari. Managing to sneak over, his shroud was broken as he grabbed a book but a slip of his hand while trying to watch the dozens around him led him to knock over a pile of spears, stirring the surrounding area. However, they all appeared to be too groogy to wake quickly, giving him time to slip back into a shroud and sneak away with the book.\n\nMeeting back up in the original chamber, they had a small scuffle with a patrol, managing to keep them from notifying too many others, but they were forced to hide breifly as some did come to investigate the area but seemed to return to their posts after some time. Hiding the new bodies in the same stalagmites as the other 4, they set about discussing their future plans, deciding that there might be a few more ${Kintari}$ down here than expected and opted on exploring further towards the temple and possible location of the sword as ${Orla}$ set about reading the spell book and sharing the spells there-in. Noting that the names of some of the spells seemed to share those of ${Sorrow's Grace}$.\n\nAs they explored, they noticed a few patrols and noted a purple eyes seeming to patrol the chambers, later finding many more, of which ${Orla}$ noted they were likely ${Sentinel Eyes}$ and would alert the caster if they were seen. Also, that the eyes where simple energy manifestations and can only be dispelled.\n\nVenturing deeper, they stumbled onto a ${Sentinel Eye}$ and found themselves fighting 2 of them. Dispelling them, they made a mental note that the ${Kintari}$ were likely aware of them being in the cave now and set about investigating a \"small\" alcove in the cave where only 2 guards seemed to be on patrol with lite groaning behind them. Slipping through the darkness to the guards, they found a large pile of corpses with what seemed to be maybe a handful of creatures still alive and groaning. Killing the guards, they pulled a survivor from the pile, ${Rustin Tujan}$, a long lost Half-Elf from the city of ${Curell}$. While he was reluctant to discuss his home as it is by his description \"A secret place\", he was quite willing to describe what he knew of the cave and seemed genuine in his desire to help and escape and seemed otherwise trustworthy after some scrutiny.\n\nPulling the kintari corpses into the pile of corpses with their new found friend, they used ${Lemuli's Tiny Hut}$ to create a small space for them to rest and hide from the certain search parties that are likely in the cave. As they woke, they took some time to meditate as ${Rustin}$ finished resting after a nice meal and without the weight of the dead on top of him.\n\nPeering out from under the pile of corpses, they saw several ${Kintari}$ now standing around and discussing where the 2 guards used to be and set about planning their next move...",

			"description": "Heading up from the vault, the group took to a tavern for some rest and then set about exploring the rooms at ${The Hoffle}$ with a bit more scrutiny.\n\nTalking to the concierge of ${The Hoffle}$, the group learned that the rooms have since been cleaned by the city guard and by the staff. He explained that they could show their warrants to the guards to gain access and that the staff could be found at ${The Woe of the Woken Waffle}$ if they wanted to try to ask them any questions. He also explained the magical locks and the logs which had been turned over to the city guard, the locks noting when they open, close, lock, and unlock.\n\nThe 10 story Inn followed the usual convention of leading the floor with the room number and left the party to ascend the many flights of stairs to reach their destinations. Knowing the rooms in question were 206 on the second floor, 509 on the fifth floor, and 710 on the seventh floor, they decided to slowly work their way up starting with 206.\n\n206 was the last known location of a male dwarf named ${Osiat Noambu}$. He had been with the inn for only a few days and had mostly been alone. Searching the room, they found wearing on the window seemingly older wear on one of the windowsills but the wear seemed older than the disappearance. Using ${Detect Magic}$ there seemed to be alchemical splotches on the walls that made it difficult to discern any lingering magical effects but they mostly seemed to be from drug usage. Talking to one of the guards, he explained that it was likely from ${Frickiyzie}$, a crazy drug that is dropped in a cauldron and served around.\n\n509 had the same drug splotches about and in talking to the guards about food and such, there were no discerning connections noted by the city's investigators and between the two floors they learned of the differences in the 7<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 10<sup>th</sup> floors where the more well off usually stayed. Seemingly linked with more \"adventurous\" and expensive delights (Which they later learned could be joined for 5000 gold each). The windowsill here contained a fairly well hidden letter, seemingly an old but continuing conversation between 2 lovers, likely a kind of affair but the conversation didn't mention it in any way. Having found it, ${Ginnet}$ stored it in his bag for possible follow up later.\n\n710 had a much heavier guard pressence, apparently ${Mrs. Rebera Dinoir}$ was still on the premises but was currently out. Presenting their warrant to the guards, they were allowed in but with an escort to ensure that nothing of ill intent occurred. Looking around, the room was much larger, seemingly the size of 3 of the previous rooms, leading them to split up a bit to look around. Investigating the area, it seemed quite clean though there were some cabinets and such that they weren't allowed to inspect. Looking around with ${Detect Magic}$ the room seemed almosst spotless, a guard noting that more attention to those thigns tends to be paid in here but a cleaner version of ${Frickiyzie}$ is enjoyed by the more well off. And after some digging around, ${Ash}$ spotted some lingering effect in the bathroom but lost its trail. But on looking around the kitchen, he managed to catch enough of it again to work out that some kind of portal magic may have been there recently. Talking with the guard, ${The Hoffle}$ is protected from the outside, but not from within, making it possible for someone inside to have possibly teleported up.\n\nWith information in hand, the group set out toward ${The Woe of the Woken Waffle}$ to grab a bite to eat and inquire with the inn's staff. Reaching the establishment, they were seated and served, each ordering some waffles to eat as they looked around. ${Erilore}$ finding a small dragonling in her large barrel of coffee seemingly responsible for keeping it warm. Talking to the small creature, she learned he had a good job and managed to convince him to point out where ${The Hoffle}$ staff were, which seemed to be out on a patio. The patio had a number of  smokers out and about, one of whom had a magnificent twirling pipe with a raven sitting on the pipe, seemingly friends with the owner. A few groups seemed to be discussing different things and ${Lucy}$ and ${Ginnet}$ took to talking to them, ${Ginnet}$ slipping into a conversation with the illustrious owner of the raven and a few others as ${Lucy}$ took to talking to the staff.\n\n${Ginnet}$'s group seemed to be a bit enthralled with the topic of ravens in the area and how bandits seem to be abusing the creatures to con and otherwise take advantage of others and giving the adorable and genius corvids an undeserved bad name.\n\n${Lucy}$ got to talking to the staff to learn a bit about the rooms and the happenings and learned a bit more about the magical cleaning of floors 7 through 10 and that some of the staff are heavy ${Frickiyzie}$ users. The staff also explained the drug, everyone having slightly different reactions to it and that the city guard are known to follow and occasionally temporarily detain the users as out in public many are known to have caused scenes or committed crimes seemingly simply from the use of the drug. They also learned that you can commonly acquire the drug at ${Icarn's Invocations}$ if you ask kindly and quietly. Though a new blend seems to be out on the town and at times when buying from others the staff had noted that some people have a much more violent or aggressive reaction. Though possibly still a possible reaction to the blend some by ${Icarn's}$.\n\nWhile the socialites were out and about, the others kept an eye out and saw nothing out of place, leaving 33G for their small gnomish waitress and no tip though they know one is not expected in ${Curell}$.\n\nBack at the ${Zephora Inn}$ with everyone, they all managed a long rest and decided to head to the looking for ravens. Stepping out from the inn, ${Eldith}$ grabbed some near by cheap alchohol and set about talking to a near-by raven. After bribing it with a ${Mechanical Spider}$, they were guided Northeast in search of shady ravens. Their guide eventually leaving them with a direction along which they ran into 2 ravens seemingly chasing each other in circles, either above a corpse or having some kind of territorial dispute.\n\nTalking the ravens down, ${Erilore}$ drunkenly convinced the ravens to talk about finding other ravens in the area, to which they request coin. After jingling through her coin purse a bit to get their requested coin, an Orc sprung forth and tried to charge at them. He seemed a bit taken a back by the number of people but was quickly subdued by ${Erilore's}$ use of ${Suggestion}$ getting the Orc to sit and talk.\n\nWhile resistant to the idea of not attacking them, he seemed to lack the wisdom to not speak freely, discussing what he knew of ${Rantej}$ and ${Filala}$ who seemed to be bandits with whom he worked. Having difficulty determining what to ${Suggest}$ to the Orc, they found themselves in a scuffle with him, ${Quincy}$ catching a war hammer to the face after a particularly lucky streak from their assailant before he was eventually subdued by ${Sleep}$, tied up, questioned, and sent packing to hand himself into ${Curell's City Guard}$ after he pointed out ${Rantej}$ on one of their warrants.\n\nIn the midst of their questioning, crossbows had begun to fire at them. Obscuring themselves in the heat of battle, ${Eldith}$ and ${Ash}$ set about subduing the crossbow bandits who seemed to be hidden in foxholes a few dozen studs out. Engaging them, they had managed to kill them with simple ${Firebolt}$ casts. Opening the foxholes revealed horribly desecrated remains, barely evident of the creatures they once were.\n\nHaving questioned the Orc, who they now knew to be ${Rurkhir}$, they learned of ${Rantej}$ and ${Filala}$ and that they stole from passersby but only enough to survive, ${Rantej}$ taking the heat and allowing ${Filala}$ to enter ${Curell}$ to purchase food and other goods. With ${Rantej's}$ missing thanks to a well placed ${Firebolt}$, they took ${Filala's Head}$ and used ${Speak with the dead}$ to inquire, convincing her that their raven ${Layla}$ was in danger:\n+ Do you know who is responsible for the kidnappings? I don't know of any kidnappings\n+ Do you know of any bandit leader? Just a few groups but no leaders\n+ Who's the most powerful bandit? Don't know\n+ Do you know of any other bandits that use ravens? To the Southeast\n+ Where's your base of operations? Here\n\nGetting ready to head back to town, ${Ash}$ had a larry don a ${Rantej Flesh Suit}$ to help bring the evidence back to hand in for their warrant. ${Erilore}$ putting together 2 decorative flower crowns for the Larrys, and ${Eldith}$ leaving 5 gold by what seemed to be their home for ${Layla}$ and ${Pete}$.\n\nBack in the town, they headed to the ${Warden Garrison}$ to hand in the remains for the warrant, leaving the 2 guards on duty green with nausea at the site of ${Ash's Larry}$. One of the lead investigators coming down and taking the evidence, seemingly unphased, stamped their warrant and noted that if the diviners give the okay, someone from their group can come pick up the reward in the morning.\n\nWaiting at the entrance, ${Erilore}$ made sure that ${Rurkhir}$ got to town and handed himself in, allowing her to drop ${Concentration}$ on the ${Suggestion}$ spell and join the others for sleep.",

With some of the ${Kintari}$ drawn north, but the guards near by took to inspecting the dead, leading the group to eventually killing them and stashing their bodies among the dead slaves.\n\nSneaking north hiding among the stalagmites in the cave, they noticed a larger number of ${Sentinel Eyes}$ in the chambers through which they were traveling (29 & 30). Slowly the group made their way into several interlaced chambers (27, 44, 25, and 43) that seemed to have resting slaves, another pool, a large gathering of ${Kintari}$ seemingly trading goods, and a exit to the surface.\n\nLooking around, ${Norwind}$ made use of the shadows and watched as ${Power Crystals}$ and various assortments of magical items were taken to the pool and dumped into it. Looking from a distance he managed to make out that the pool was seemingly just Red, Greeen, and Blue, no Silver seemed to be showing and he didn't see any ${Silver Power Crystals}$ being taken over or dumped into the pool.\n\nSpending some time in the area, ${Xylaris}$ took to investigating the ${Kintari}$ that were walking around and learned about the ${Priests}$, ${Warriors}$, and ${Flame Servants}$. As they observed the area, both she and ${Norwind}$ gathered that while those 3 make up the majority in the area, there appear to be some larger more powerful ${Kintari}$ within the cave as well, but neither was able to quite make them out in the crowds. They also took a moment to disguise ${Orla Jr. Jr.}$ but as they did they noticed that the cave seemed devoid of any of life, presuming that the ${Kintari}$ had hunted anything in the cave.\n\nTalking with ${Rustin}$ about the cave, he noted he didn't know anything about the northern part of the cave, but did know of the portal where he retrieved crates to the south.\n\nInvestigating the area, ${Norwind}$ snuck around the chambers and made his way north (into chamber 24) and looking into an adjacent chamber (11 & 6) saw 2 ${Sentinel Eyes}$ that seemed to be guarding a corridor to another area.

After which they huddled outside in a near-by alley and contemplated their plans for the day.\n\nDiscussing hunting plans, they settled on Scrying on one of the criminals they could fairly clearly make out in one of the warrants. As ${Eldith}$ watched, she saw a lone man seemingly talking to himself when a near by shadow laden spot seemed to reply, mentioning a ${Red Carriage}$ with 2 horses and the ${South Western City Gate}$ before the lone creature quickly left.\n\nDiscussing ways to fool the would be assassin and protect his would be target, they discussed a number of plans before realizing that no time had been given and that the assassin was likely already on his way to the gate. Sending ${Pixie}$ ahead, ${Eldith}$ took off on her ${Witch's Broom}$ as the group took off for the gate themselves. Getting near by, ${Pixie}$ noted that the carriage had already passed and was further down the road.\n\nRushing down the road, ${Eldith}$ and ${Ginnet}$ managed to pull out a head of everyone, followed by ${Lucy}$ then shortly after by everyone else.\n\nBy the time they reached the carriage, it was flipped on its side and the assassin was crawling out from the door, covered in blood. Seeing them approach, he slipped behind the carriage and became invisible, as ${Ginnet}$ realized after coming around the side and using ${Color Spray}$, which failed to blind the assassin but did reveal him. The ensuing fight putting pressure on ${Ginnet}$ and ${Eldith}$ as they striggled to subdue him, but ${Ginnet}$ managed to kill him after his invisibility was removed, driving ${Andiziyo}$ into his skull and killing him while preserving all of his loot.\n\nAs they fought the assassin, ${Lucy}$ spotted some ruffling in the bushes from what seemed to be a dead body being dragged into them. Calling out to the rest of the group she ran in to see what was happening and found a dead guard's body. Charging through the bushes she looked around and managed to catch the faint impression of a creature hiding on the bushes. As she stared at it, its eyes flashed at her, sending a tremor down her spine as some invisible creature lept out atnd attacked her. ${Lucy}$ tried to hold her own, managing to catch the the creature had some scales that appeared to be able to make it invisible, has terrible claws, and can seeming call a sword out of thin air. As the others ran in, ${Lucy}$ threw down a ${Soulmist Bomb}$ to try to evade its attacks but fell unconscious just as the others got close enough.\n\n${Quincy}$ used his ${Dionysian Blessing}$ to remove ${Disadvantage}$ from everyone in 100 studs of him and ${Ash}$ used a ranged heal to bring ${Lucy}$ back to consciousness just in time for her to make out the snake creature in the mist fairly clearly thanks to ${Quincy's}$ blessing. And as the others arrived, they could make out ${Lucy}$ and her adversary, but could not make out any details of the creature she was fighting before it fled the scene. Giving chase, they weren't able to find any sign of the creature.\n\nHelping ${Lucy}$ up, the group retrieved the carriage's horses and gathered the now alive but unconscious woman on one horse, and the corpse of the guard and the assassin on another and began heading into town as ${Ginnet}$ inspected the assassin's loot...",

As he took note, he noticed a familiar non-kintari humanoid leave the watched corridor with several others, however in the lighting and traffic it was difficult to make out who it may have been.\n\nAs he kept an eye out, the group struggled with sneaking. Spotted by slaves at one point, managing to use ${Major Illusion}$ to hide and the slaves feigning ignorance when approached by the ${Kintari}$, then further down the cave ${Orla}$ slipped out but managing to blink back in and hide despite being seen by another group of slaves.\n\nThe group managed to catch up with ${Norwind}$ and they caught a glimpse of a passing group of slaves that seemed to toss a dagger or sword of some kind into a small space that on looking at it seemed to be a bit of a ${Blind Spot}$ coming through the passage between chambers (11 to 24). Eager approaching the discarded dagger, ${Norwind}$ managed to keep his cool as a group of ${Savants}$ and ${Priests}$ wandered by heading down into the busy area. Grabbing the dagger he rejoined his companions and they set about sneaking into the next chamber to get a better view of the area with the stationary eyes.\n\nWhile they shuffled, the ${White and Blue Kintarian Priests}$ began returning from the busy area but the ${Savants}$ seemed to stay. Giving them some time to pass, the group quietly shuffled in afterwards. In the chamber they managed a good enough view of what appeared to be the ${Watch Area}$ where dozens of magically inclined kintari mulled about with several ${Savants}$ seemingly standing around as guards.\n\nWatching the traffic of slaves coming down and around and seemingly still heading towards the pool they passed someways back, they took to continuing northward. On their way, they found a cache of ${Kintari Weapons}$, another pool, a portal buried deep in a corridor with a pile of crates near by, but guarded. Passing those features, determined to head for the temple, and more specifically the blade, they reached a fork and decided to try to find a place to rest and noticed that the \"traffic\" in the area seemed to die down. Slipping along a passage and into another sparsely occupied chamber they contemplated finding a place to rest and noticed but a few ${Kintari Warriors}$ lazing around on the ground. Slipping into a small nook, they took turns on watch as they rested, noting a group of slaves seemingly doing the same in a larger nook near by.\n\nExploring the area before they took to rest, ${Norwind}$ spotted a seeming ${Elder Kintari}$ with minimal guards presiding over a dozen or so large stone tablets and appearing to transcribe something onto scrolls. Deciding to leave it be and the area seeming lite at best for traffic, he returned to the group and informed them of what he had seen.\n\nDeciding the area was okay for resting, ${Orla}$ and ${Torinn}$ took watch and as they rested they noticed that the ${Kintari}$ agreed this was a good spot to rest and they watched as a large group of ${Kintari Warriors}$ shuffled in and slept in the chamber (4). However, thanks to their long rest and needing to change watch, the warriors left seemingly back to their shifts before the group was fully awake, leaving them a similar opening to leave as when they came in.\n\nTaking in the area they readied themselves for a push toward the blade, knowing that ${Po}$ had at least 7 more days to go...",

			"description": "Sharing the loot from the assassin, ${Ginnet}$ handed out some loot to the others as they made their way back to the gates. Delivering the bodies to the guards, they immediately identified the woman as ${Mrs. Dinoir}$, which left the guards puzzled as to how she ended up with the party since she had just left. However, the guards weren't comfortable leaving her unconscious body with them and informed the group they could come speak with them about her in the morning at the ${Warden Garrison}$.\n\nWhile talking with the guards, the Captain of the watch asked to be taken down and shown the area where the carriage was, which the party did, traveling with a portion of the guards. As they traveled, they noted that the guards here seemed particularly competent and learned that ${Mrs. Dinoir}$ had a body double who was currently staying at ${The Hoffle}$ to make her illusion of still being inside the city's walls more believable.\n\nReturning to town, they stopped by the garrison for more information and to hand in their warrant, being told the usual night response of \"Come back in the morning to get paid\" and then left and took a short rest near the garrison while they discussed their activities. With some planning, they set about getting ready to rest for the night as ${Eldith}$ took to ${Scrying}$ on one of the guards from ${Mrs. Dinoir's}$ envoy. As she did so, she found herself looking upon an empty bush with no sign of the guard.\n\nSlightly recognizing the bushy are, she came to the conclusion that the corpse had somehow been rendered invisible and that it, and possibly the other dozen or so bodies they expected, were hidden out amongst the bushes. With this information the group went back to the garrison instead of the Inn and set out to meet with the guards at the gate again to scour the area from the gate to the crash.\n\nScouring the area with ${Ash's Larrys}$, a combination of ${Detect Magic}$ and ${Lucy's Spyglass}$, as well as the small division of guards with them, they managed to find 16 additional bodies. Working with the guard, the bodies were hauled back to the ${Warden Garrison}$ were the Wizards employed by the city would take a look, as usual, in the morning. Greeting ${Statia}$ as they got back, they all caught up on activities and got some rest, planning to catch up with ${Mrs. Dinoir}$ in the morning.\n\nTalking with ${Mrs. Dinoir}$ the group learned of ${Omoyo Zenic}$, a red scaled dragonborn who was her chauffer and had handled getting the carriage. Suspecting he may have tipped off the shadowy figure, they inquired further and discovered that ${Mrs. Dinoir}$ chose her route out of the city that day at random right as she left, attempting to avoid the very thing they suspected. However, she also noted that while there a number of streets within the city, there are only 4 to 6 real paths out of the city once one sets out into the wilderness depending on one's mode of transportation. She also noted that before leaving, ${Athis}$ and ${Cesis}$ were supposed to meet her but were surprisingly absent when she left.\n\nAfter describing the plan, she recalled the tragic events, describing how the guards were seemingly felled quickly by large sharp claws, though she admitted it was a bit of a blur from the back of her carriage, but she was quite sure she had watched all of the guards behind her be killed before the ones on her carriage as well as her chauffer were killed.\n\nAppreciating the worth of the adventurers in front of her, she offered the party ${10000,,orange}$G as a reward for helping find her husband. And after some discussion she was willing to give some of the money up front to help pay for some items or informants if needed.\n\nLeaving ${Mrs. Dinoir}$, the group set out back to the ${Warden Garrison}$ to speak with the investigators about their reward and to search for ${Omoyo's}$ body to use ${Speak with the Dead}$. Finding his body still alive, they searched out the dragonborn looking for scaled bodies and managed to find him by plucking a scale off, confirming that the severed body parts are visible, leading them to severing his head so that ${Quincy}$ could focus on the head for some answers (${@Alucevum 8, 319}$):\n+ ${@Have you ever seen or heard of a snake/humanoid hybrid?}$ ${ No, can’t say that I have}$\n+ ${@What do you remember before you passed away?}$ ${ Trying to get Mrs. Dinoir to safety}$\n+ ${@Do you know who the investigators Mrs. Dinoir hired?}$ ${ Athis and Cesis}$\n+ ${@Was there anything unusual about the carriage you drove yesterday?}$ ${ Nope, handled just fine}$\n+ ${@Do you know anything about a powerful invisibility spell?}$ ${ No, don’t know much about it}$\n\nWith that information in hand, they asked the investigator currently working if he could get them any information on these investigators, which he set off into the garrison in search of information as he had none himself. While he was out, ${Eldith}$ tried ${Scrying}$ on ${Athis}$ and got nothing. The investigator returning noted that the 2 people they noted were decently well known private investigators in the area and knew their way around. Usually the were reached simply by putting word out onto the street that you were looking for them and the investigator offered to help them with just that.\n\nSeeking more information, ${Quincy}$ also sought ${Communion}$ with ${Dionysus}$ and got 3 more questions answered:\n+ ${@Are the Athis and Cesis still alive?}$ ${Unclear}$\n+ ${@Are the Athis and Cesis still in Curell?}$ ${No}$\n+ ${@Did Athis or Cesis betray Mrs. Dinoir?}$ ${No}$\n\nContemplating other ways of gathering more information, they managed to talk their way into cooperation from the city guard to get some help from the diviners that they have, however the investigator noted that their skills are limited and seem to pale in comparison to that of the party.\n\nThey pondered their next course of action in the bowels of the garrison as they contempled where to go next...",

They mentioned they were looking for Urchins and ${Uigi}$ snapped his fingers and a few popped out from the shadows and with a quick gesture took the groups gold from ${Erilore}$ after she explained the mission to try and find the 2 missing investigators, giving another a little extra coin to try and find her a secret. ${Eldith}$ talking to another, tossed him 5 gold to try and find ${Emereta}$ who they suspect is somewhere in the city.\n\nWhile the group innocently lurked through the shadows, ${Quincy}$ learned a bit more about enchanting and got a loaner ${Enchanter's Kit}$ from ${N'orel}$ as his was still on their boat, learning some basic ${Fire Enchantments}$.\n\nMeeting back up, ${Eldith}$ took to ${Scrying}$ on a few \"near by\" creatures and bandits to possibly gain some direction for the group.\n\nScrying on one of the Urchins before they all took a long rest, she learned that the little fellow was indeed asking around but also seemed to be in the midst of some other kind of thievery. But he had taken to asking another urchin while he was out and seemed to be coming up empty. When the group awoke, she took to scrying on some of the bandits as well, none of whom seemed prepared.\n\nA female gnome was one of the 300G bounties and she seemed to be talking to a group about issues securing food for their group, seemingly discussing kidnapping a few people for ransom but nothing on the scale of the disappearences.\n\nFor 500G, she found a purple tiefling with black strips, different from ${Quincy's}$ friend, that seemed to be talking to a lithe blue dragonborn or a blue tiefling about their protection ring and how the shops along the river banks have been having trouble paying their share and discussing what to do to keep the money coming in and the issue of the local wildlife becoming more aggressive.\n\nShopping around for a bit while they contemplated their options, they settled on investigating the shops along the river as they killed time waiting for sunset to meet back up with the urchins.\n\nHeading down, the far northeast shops on the other side of the river and found a small lively market of smaller trinkets, art, food, and such. A shop by the name of ${Soutry's Soufflés}$ seeming to keep a decent gathering. Exploring a bit, they spotted a tent with some scratched and wandering in to ask about the work.\n\nAlways curious of art, ${Lucy}$ inquired about some of the works and learned that there was a good portion of local art but that the tent owner himself was quite the collector, putting out works he had grown tired of for sale and also helping the local artists to sell their works, though business had grown slow of late with the wildlife issues. To ${Lucy's}$ dismay however, ${Scorsi}$ was well aware of ${Ilerar}$ and had even helped sell the pirate many of his paintings, as ${Ilerar}$ is a large fan of ${Vonk}$, an artist in ${Coneixager}$.\n\nPeering into the corners of the art shop, they ended up buying a few works of their own to decorate the ${Ntanti}$ and ${Lucy}$ put 100G down for a glorious painting of ${Dionysus}$ in the nude, which ${Scorsi}$ promised to find and leave a note at the temple for her.\n\nWith the sun starting to set, they ventured back to the temple and met up with the urchins, learning that they were only able to learn that the investigators had disappeared, the last person to have seen them likely being a local kook, ${Ms. Resonia}$, who kept to herself in the southwestern part of town. And as the urchins had no other leads, the group set out to pay her a visit.\n\nHeading across the bridge, night set in and the eyes of the local wildlife began to flate, giving an ominous pressence to the tree line in the distance as they walked the southern most street of the city. The shops were closed and many were in for the night, though a few were perched near campfires with a few others for a few make shift parties of sorts.\n\nGetting closer, they heard the ramblings of ${Ms. Resonia}$ and set about asking her a few questions, though her answers were confusing. ${Eldith}$ using ${Detect Magic}$ at the mention of things near her but found nothing.\n\nGiving the lady her space for a moment, they stepped back around a bend and ${Quincy}$ took some time to ${Commune}$ with ${Dionysus}$:\n+ ${@Is Ms. Resonia affected by a curse?}$ ${No}$\n+ ${@Are the ghosts that she sees kidnapping people?}$ ${Yes}$ (After a brief moment to interpret the response)\n+ ${@Are the ghosts and the strange wild animals related?}$ ${No}$\n\nSensing a need for more help, ${Quincy}$ also tried casting ${Divine Intervention}$ to be able to see the ghosts ${Ms. Resonia}$ spoke of but did not manage success.\n\nBeginning to suspect that she may know something and heading back to her, ${Quincy}$, following up on her mention of ghosts being near-by, used ${Detect Good and Evil}$, getting a sense of a few ${Fey}$ creatures above them, 2 ${Aberrations}$ near them, and a glaring sense of Good from ${Resoina}$, she seeming to have been blessed in some way.\n\nMaintaining his composure, he walked the group over to a corner and casually explained their predicament as he contemplated the extra holding capacity he wished he had and recalled a note that ${Illan}$ should be back in town tomorrow and may have a ${Bag of Holding}$...",

			"description": "Once everyone was up to speed on their current predicament, ${Erilore}$ took a moment to greet the fairies that ${Quincy}$ had sensed, but saying \"Hi\" seem to drive them away as ${Quincy}$ sensed them leaving.\n\nLooking around ${Ginnet}$ noticed some rustling in a back alley and found a large beetle, maybe 3 studs long, rustling around in some garbage. Jumping back, he headed back toward the group who sought out the beetles and found a few more of varying size, killing one with ${Blight}$ before seeking out some locals to inquire.\n\nSitting with a few locals who had gathered around a late night fire they learned that the beetles were a bit recent, seemingly a trade down from the racoons and such that used to be in the area and seem to have left. Heading back into the city, the forest maintained its erie sense but the trip back remained uneventful.\n\nAs the morning came, they pondered what was happening around the area and ${Eldith}$ tried sending out to ${Nachaul}$, their old cook from ${Ascaqua}$ but got no reply to her message. Finishing their breakfast, a guard came in and gave them word that ${Ilerar}$ had arrived.\n\nHeading to the castle they brought ${Ilerar}$ his crates. The missing one gave him pause and the group explained the ${Smeryby}$ and other tales of ${Lurus}$. While ${Ilerar}$ seemed hesitant about the ordeal as he noted the lake was brimming with fish when they left the crates, he still accepted the crates and declared their debt settled. However, he seemed to have little interest in further dealings with the group as they asked about possible other deals they could make as he left with his crew.\n\nLeaving the meeting room, they found themselves flagged down by ${Meister Evan}$ who requested they hear out him and ${Meister Antoku}$. Sticking around, the meisters bickered briefly about ${Evan's}$ request to them as 2 tieflings, 2 dragonborn walked in, the ones from ${Arcanous Edous}$, the seemingly ${Arcane Society}$ building but not.\n\nEntering, the groups bickered briefly but both stayed to hear out the Meisters regarding the seeming siege of the city by wildlife, seemingly attacking in their day-to-day hunting and prowling activities with some of the animals appearing in inexplainable places like the library, despite security measures that should prevent such a thing. Both groups seemingly willing to acknowledge the other is present and helping with this, but not willing to cooperate directly. And while this new path should take precedent over the missing people, the Meisters suspect that even if they aren't related, investigating one will likely take you across the trail of the other at the least.\n\nLeaving, ${Ginnet}$ found himself accosted by a salesman who seemed to be trying to reach him about his \"Carriage Insurance\". Speaking with him a bit he was with ${Carriage's Keep}$ and was offering to keep the carriage cleaned and in repair for a modest fee of 30G a month, the salesman noting that he had noticed the carriage out by their Inn had been covered in bird dung for quite some time. ${Ginnet}$ noted that he'd consider it right before a guard berated the salesman for wandering the halls and accosting people, sending the salesman scurrying away from ${Ginnet}$ but towards another carriage owning individual.\n\nHeading into the square, they did some shopping and stopped by ${Illan's}$ cart to buy somethings. As they looked for ${Bags of Holding}$, the cart shopkeeper noted that he had a few in his storage tent but that it had become infested by some of the nasty critters plaguing the city. Considering it, he offered them a single box of goods in exchange for clearing out his storage tent, which they accepted and set off toward the tent.\n\nReaching the tent, they looked around and found mostly a plain, but sturdy, tent. Opening it, they found several lights powered by ${Power Crystals}$ and were quickly set upon by beetles that they later discovered exploded in a bright flash on death, leaving them briefly blinded as ${Quincy}$ used his ${Dionysian Blessing}$ to remove the disadvantage. Setting on killing the rest, they made short work of most, ${Eldith}$ discovering that a ${Red Power Crystal}$ can double the damage of a spell and passing it back and forth with ${Erilore}$ to exploit the ${Necrotic}$ weakness of the beetles. However, in the skirmish, a one lone beetle-scorpion hybrid like critter escaped underground and fled towards the forest.\n\nLooking around in the boxes, they decided to take a box filled to the brim with alchemy and enchanting ingredients and set off to let ${Illan}$ know that he can get into his storage tent again and that he may want to reinforce his floor...",

			"description": "As they readied themselves to sneak and possible battle their way into the temple, they peered into the various corners of the cave seeking the exit to the temple. Along the way, finding a few exits back to the surface before finding their way into the temple.\n\nWith the rogues scouting a head, ${Norwind}$ and ${Xylaris}$ found ${Great Wyrms}$ in some of the other far corners that lead to surface exits or dead ends. Learning that the ${Kintari}$ seemed to be working with at least one of them in some way. However, the guards by the one ${Norwind}$ found seemed a bt more skilled than the average ${Kintari Warrior}$ but with some planning and sleight of hand from ${Norwind}$ as well as ${Orla}$ and ${Torinn}$ (After some flailing shenanigans) managed to aid ${Norwind}$'s escape from the deadend without any combat. ${Xylaris}$ having wandered into a dark part of the cave and almost literally stumbling across a sleeping ${Great Wyrm}$.\n\nRegrouped, they pushed forward and found themselves at a narrow, well guarded, corridor and after some sneaking, ${Torrin}$ found himself cut off from everyone else with ${Rustin}$ as the slaves hauling goods to and fro continued to move about with their escorts. Looking for an opening and after some planning with his companions, ${Torinn}$ chucked his trident behind a group of slaves and zipped it back to his hand, leading the guards to head towards those slaves.\n\nThat slight provocation seeming to be all the was needed, the slaves almost all at once erupted into rebellion charging the ${Kintari}$ with the very weapons that had been hauling around.\n\nMany of the slaves perished, killed by the might of the weapons they tried to use or over come by insanity and crumbling. The rest charged forth, killing some ${Kintari}$, but many dying with the first push. But those who survived, continued to fight, killing foe after foe ast hey pushed on, distracting the ${Kintari}$ in the area as the group pushed forward, sneaking past the ${Kintari Savants}$ and down a hallway that finally had the deteriating decore of the temple.\n\nAs they rounded the seemingly last corner before the main hall of the temple, they found themselves all but cut off by an all to familiar pattern of packed corpses...",
